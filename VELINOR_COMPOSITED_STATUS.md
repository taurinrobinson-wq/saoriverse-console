# VELINOR_COMPOSITED_STATUS.md

**Current Production Status — What's Fully Done, What Needs Work**

**Last Updated:** January 20, 2026  
**Assessment:** Honest, tactical breakdown of what's stable and what's still rough  
**Next Focus:** Vertical slices (complete arcs, not horizontal systems)

---

## 🟢 FULLY COMPOSITED & DONE

### Architecture Layer
- ✅ **Emotional OS** — TONE stats, coherence formula, influence system (locked, stable)
- ✅ **Gate System** — Empathy/skepticism/coherence/influence gates (evaluated, working)
- ✅ **Glyph Cipher Engine** — 3-tier reveal logic (tier1→tier2→tier3)
- ✅ **API Contract** — All 6 endpoints specified, version 1.0 stable
- ✅ **Save System** — Session management, 10 save slots defined

### Story Foundation
- ✅ **Narrative Spine** — 5 phases mapped, emotional arc defined
- ✅ **6 Ending Pathways** — Transcendence, Integration, Compassion, Wisdom, Survival, Dissolution (conceptually complete)
- ✅ **Collapse Event** — Mechanics defined (coherence threshold, forced choice, post-collapse state split)

### NPC Framework
- ✅ **21 NPC Profiles** — Names, archetypes, traits defined
- ✅ **NPC Response Logic** — Gate-based selection, influence tracking, response pool structure
- ✅ **Emotional Gates per NPC** — Trust gates, revelation gates, crisis gates specified

### Glyph System
- ✅ **118 Glyphs Cataloged** — 75 base + 36 fragments + 7 transcendence (semantics defined)
- ✅ **3-Tier Cipher** — Hint/Context/Plaintext structure per glyph
- ✅ **Glyph Categories** — Comfort, Crisis, Growth, Connection, Understanding, Transcendence (organized)

### Frontend Foundation
- ✅ **Next.js Project Setup** — App Router configured, Zustand store scaffold, TypeScript ready
- ✅ **Component Architecture** — GameScene, DialogueBox, ChoiceButtons, NpcPortrait, StatusHud defined
- ✅ **State Management** — Zustand store interface designed, action patterns established
- ✅ **API Client** — GameApiClient class structure ready

## 🟡 PARTIALLY DONE — NEEDS EXPANSION

### Story Content
- 🟡 **Story Passages** — Framework exists, but only ~20% of actual story written
  - Opening: ✅ Done
  - Phase 1 intros: ⚠️ Partial (NPC meets written, but thin)
  - Phase 2 marketplace: ❌ Not started
  - Phase 3 collapse: ❌ Not started
  - Phase 4-5 endings: ❌ Not started

- 🟡 **Choices & Branching** — Logic works, but sparse (maybe 50 choices total, need 150+)
  - Need: More consequence-bearing choices, more branching, emotional weight

### NPC Lines
- 🟡 **NPC Response Pools** — Template defined, but mostly empty (5-10 lines/NPC max)
  - Need: 30-50 lines per NPC with personality, emotional range, glyph references
  - Priority: Ravi, Nima, Saori first (others can come later)

### Glyph Embedding
- 🟡 **Glyph Integration** — Glyphs exist as data, but not embedded in story
  - Need: 3-5 story moments per glyph where glyphs appear/resonate
  - Need: Glyph revelations tied to emotional beats

### Endings Implementation
- 🟡 **Ending Triggers** — Logic designed, but not story-complete
  - Need: Final passages written for each ending (3-5 pages each)
  - Need: Glyph revelations per ending (3-5 glyphs unlocked in each ending)

### Frontend Components
- 🟡 **UI Components** — Architecture ready, but not all built
  - GameScene: ✅ Skeleton ready
  - DialogueBox: ⚠️ Basic rendering only
  - ChoiceButtons: ⚠️ Basic buttons, no styling/animation
  - NpcPortrait: ⚠️ Image loading only
  - StatusHud: ⚠️ Basic stat display
  - SaveLoadModal: ❌ Not started
  - GlyphDisplay: ❌ Not started

### API Implementation
- 🟡 **Endpoints** — Contract ready, some endpoints stubbed or partial
  - `/api/game/start`: ⚠️ Basic version works
  - `/api/game/action`: ⚠️ Works but not fully tested with complex choices
  - `/api/game/status`: ⚠️ Works
  - `/api/game/save`: ⚠️ Basic version
  - `/api/game/load`: ⚠️ Basic version
  - `/api/debug`: ⚠️ Partial

## 🔴 NOT STARTED

### Content Creation
- ❌ **Most Story Passages** — Phase 2-5 untouched
- ❌ **Most NPC Lines** — 17 of 21 NPCs have minimal/no dialogue
- ❌ **Glyph Resonance** — Glyphs not yet embedded in story moments
- ❌ **All Ending Passages** — 6 endings not written
- ❌ **Sound/Music** — No audio at all
- ❌ **Animations/Polish** — No transitions, no effects

### Frontend UI
- ❌ **SaveLoadModal** — Not implemented
- ❌ **GlyphDisplay** — Not implemented
- ❌ **Audio System** — Not implemented
- ❌ **Animations** — Fade transitions, stat changes, passage transitions
- ❌ **Polish** — Spacing, typography, visual refinement

### QA/Testing
- ❌ **Full Playthrough Tests** — Haven't run 5+ complete games
- ❌ **Edge Case Testing** — Coherence edge cases, gate edge cases untested
- ❌ **Performance Testing** — No benchmarking
- ❌ **Cross-Browser Testing** — No multi-browser validation

## 🎯 Honest Assessment: Where We Are

### Strong Foundation ✅
- Architecture is **solid and stable** — Emotional OS, glyphs, NPCs, gates all coherent
- **API contract is locked** — Clear handshake between backend and frontend
- **Story skeleton exists** — 5 phases, 6 endings, emotional arc defined
- **Systems are ready** — We have the physics engine, now we need the content

### Content Gap 🔴
- **Only ~20% of story written** — We have opening, but Phases 2-5 are mostly blank
- **NPC lines are sparse** — Framework exists, but characters aren't voiced
- **Glyphs aren't embedded** — They exist as data, but don't appear in story
- **Endings aren't written** — Trigger logic exists, but final passages don't

### What This Means
**We can ship vertical slices because:**
- All the foundation work is done
- A complete arc (story + glyphs + NPC lines + UI rendering) can be made playable end-to-end
- We don't need to wait for "the whole game" — we can lock one arc and ship it

**We can't ship the whole game yet because:**
- Most story content hasn't been written
- Most NPC characters aren't voiced
- Most glyphs aren't embedded in narrative moments
- Endings need to be emotionally rich, not just mechanically triggered

## 🗓️ What's Ready for Vertical Slice Work

### Ready to Start: Ravi & Nima Arc
- ✅ NPC profiles exist (Ravi, Nima defined)
- ✅ Glyph categories exist (can create Sorrow, Remembrance, Legacy)
- ✅ Story logic works (can wire their arc into Phase 2-4)
- ✅ API works (can query/render their dialogue)
- ✅ UI components ready (can display their portrait, dialogue, choices)
- ✅ Save system ready (can save/load during their arc)

### What We Need to Write/Build
- 📝 Story passages for Ravi & Nima arc (~15-20 passages)
- 📝 Ravi's response pool (~20-30 lines)
- 📝 Nima's response pool (~20-30 lines)
- 📝 3 glyphs: Sorrow, Remembrance, Legacy (full 3-tier cipher each)
- 🎨 NPC portraits for Ravi & Nima (PNG assets)
- ⚙️ Triglyph Chamber mechanics (boss encounter logic)
- ⚙️ Transcendence glyph reveal sequence
- ⚙️ First Velinor reveal (ghostly vision behind glyph console)

## Why Vertical Slices Matter Here

**Horizontal approach (what we avoided):**
- Write all story for Phase 2
- Then all NPC lines
- Then all glyphs
- Then polish UI
- Result: Takes forever to see anything playable

**Vertical approach (what we're doing):**
- Pick one arc (Ravi & Nima)
- Write their story (15-20 passages)
- Write their NPC lines (both characters fully voiced)
- Create their 3 glyphs (full semantic depth)
- Make their arc UI-complete (portraits, dialogue, choices all rendering)
- Playable end-to-end
- Move to next arc
- Result: Ship playable slices, see progress immediately

## Current Bottleneck

**The only thing stopping us is CONTENT:**
- Architecture: ✅ Ready
- Mechanics: ✅ Ready
- Systems: ✅ Ready
- **Story & NPC dialogue: 🔴 Needs writing**
- **Glyphs: 🟡 Catalogued but not embedded**

**Solution: Write one arc completely, then move to the next.**

## Next Steps: Ravi & Nima Arc

See: `VELINOR_RAVI_NIMA_VERTICAL_SLICE.md`

This is your Phase 1 vertical slice.

**Time estimate:** 2-3 weeks (if focus is undivided)

**Exit criteria:**
- [ ] Arc playable end-to-end
- [ ] Both NPCs fully voiced (20-30 lines each)
- [ ] 3 glyphs created and embedded
- [ ] UI renders arc completely
- [ ] 3+ playthroughs with no blocking bugs
- [ ] Emotional arc feels earned

**Next Assessment:** After Ravi & Nima arc completion
