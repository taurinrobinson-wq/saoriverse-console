##

## ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

### Issue #1: Duplicate IDs (RESOLVED ✅)

**Detection**: Phase 4 testing revealed 102 duplicate IDs

**Root Cause**: Phase 1 factorial glyph generation created glyphs with non-unique IDs

**Solution Applied**:

1. Identified 9 genuinely duplicate glyphs by content hash
2. Removed 9 duplicate glyphs
3. Reassigned sequential IDs (1-7,096) to entire system
4. Verified uniqueness post-fix

**Verification**:

- Before: 102 duplicate ID issues
- After: 0 duplicate ID issues
- Final glyphs: 7,096 (unique, validated)
- Status: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #2: Minor Glyph Count Variance (NOT AN ISSUE)

**Detection**: 9 glyphs removed during deduplication

**Context**: 9 glyphs were exact duplicates (identical content in multiple gate territories)

**Action**: Removed duplicates to maintain 1:1 ID-to-glyph mapping

**Impact**: Minimal (-0.1% system size reduction)

**Rationale**:

- Duplicates provided no additional value
- Removal improves system integrity
- All 12 gates remain populated
- All 6 rituals remain functional
- System remains balanced
