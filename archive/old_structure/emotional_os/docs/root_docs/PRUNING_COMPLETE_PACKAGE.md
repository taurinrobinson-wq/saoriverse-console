##

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from emotional_os.glyphs.advanced_pruning_engine import AdvancedPruningEngine

# Initialize
engine = AdvancedPruningEngine(
    glyph_lexicon_path="emotional_os/glyphs/glyph_lexicon_rows.json"
)

# Evaluate
candidates = engine.evaluate_all_glyphs()

# Get statistics
stats = engine.get_pruning_statistics()
print(f"Pruning {stats['total_to_prune']} glyphs")

# Create report
report = engine.create_pruning_report(
    output_path="emotional_os/glyphs/PRUNING_REPORT.json"
)
```


### With Match History (Recommended)

```python
engine = AdvancedPruningEngine(
    glyph_lexicon_path="emotional_os/glyphs/glyph_lexicon_rows.json",
    match_history_path="emotional_os/glyphs/glyph_match_history.json"
)

candidates = engine.evaluate_all_glyphs()
```


### With Factorial Expansion

```python

# Generate new glyphs
from emotional_os.glyphs.glyph_factorial_engine import GlyphFactorialEngine

factorial = GlyphFactorialEngine()
factorial.load_primary_glyphs()
factorial.generate_all_combinations()  # 85,264 candidates
factorial.score_combinations()

# Prune intelligently
pruning = AdvancedPruningEngine()
candidates = pruning.evaluate_all_glyphs()

# Keep high-quality ones
kept = [c for c in candidates if not c.should_prune]
print(f"Expansion: 85,264 → {len(kept)} high-quality glyphs")

# Sync to JSON
factorial.sync_to_json(kept)
```


##

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Scoring Components

```
Signal Strength: 0-1 (emotional clarity)
Redundancy: 0-1 (role collision)
Tone Distribution: 0-1 (palette balance)
Activation: 0-1 (usage frequency / 5)
Reaction Participation: 0-1 (system involvement)

Combined Score = weighted sum → 0.0 to 1.0
```


### Decision Thresholds

```
score ≥ 0.70  → CRITICAL KEEP (95% confidence)
score ≥ 0.45  → KEEP (80% confidence)
score ≥ 0.25  → MARGINAL (60% confidence)
score < 0.25  → PRUNE CANDIDATE (70% confidence)
```


### Protection Rules

```
IF glyph_id ≤ 64          → ALWAYS KEEP (base elements)
IF reaction_participation ≥ 0.9 → ALWAYS KEEP (catalysts)
IF signal_strength ≥ 0.70 → USUALLY KEEP
```


##

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

### Enhancement 1: Emotional Family Clustering

Group related glyphs, keep exemplars:

```python
families = {
    'grief': ['Recursive Ache', 'Reverent Ache', ...],
    'joy': ['Euphoric Yearning', 'Exalted Joy', ...],
}

for family, glyphs in families.items():
    # Keep highest signal + usage exemplar
    # Prune near-duplicates
```


### Enhancement 2: Pruning Archive Capsule

Archive for resurrection:

```python
pruned = [c for c in candidates if c.should_prune]
archive_path = engine.archive_pruned_glyphs(pruned)

# → Saved as JSON, can resurrect anytime
```


### Enhancement 3: Confidence-Based Filtering

Use confidence scores:

```python
high_confidence = [c for c in pruned if c.prune_confidence > 0.85]

# Safe to prune (confident decisions)

medium_confidence = [c for c in pruned if 0.70 <= c.prune_confidence <= 0.85]

# Can prune with review

low_confidence = [c for c in pruned if c.prune_confidence < 0.70]

# Manual review recommended
```


##

## 📈 Expected Results

### On Base Glyphs (64 total)

```
Before pruning: 64 glyphs
After advanced pruning: 64 glyphs (all protected)
Result: 0% pruning (as expected - base elements are sacred)
```


### On Factorial Expansion (85,264 candidates)

```
Before basic pruning: 85,264 combinations
After top-15% scoring: 12,794 candidates
After advanced 5-layer: 6,000-8,000 survivors
Result: 93% reduction, but high quality
```


### Tone Distribution Before/After

```
Before: May be overrepresented (e.g., 40% "Molten")
After: Balanced across 12 Saonyx tones
Result: Rich, diverse emotional palette
```


##

## 🎓 How to Use Each Layer

### Layer 1: Signal Strength

**When:** Always. Acts as baseline filter.
**Use case:** Remove weakly-defined glyphs.

```python
if candidate.signal_strength < 0.30:
    print("Weak signal → candidate for pruning")
```


### Layer 2: Trace Role Redundancy

**When:** Detecting duplicates
**Use case:** Collapse same function + same tone

```python
if candidate1.trace_role == candidate2.trace_role:
    if candidate1.tone == candidate2.tone:
        # One is redundant
        keep_higher_signal(candidate1, candidate2)
```


### Layer 3: Usage Frequency

**When:** Production runs (most important)
**Use case:** Keep proven performers

```python
if candidate.match_history > 0:
    print("✓ Proven in production → strong signal to keep")
else:
    print("? Never activated → consider for pruning")
```


### Layer 4: Tone Diversity

**When:** Maintaining palette
**Use case:** Prevent overrepresentation

```python
if tone_count["Molten"] > total_glyphs * 0.33:
    if candidate.tone == "Molten" and candidate.signal < 0.7:
        print("Overrepresented tone → candidate for pruning")
```


### Layer 5: Reaction Anchoring

**When:** System integrity
**Use case:** Protect catalysts

```python
if "Forgiveness" in candidate.name:
    print("✓ Reaction catalyst → ALWAYS KEEP")
```


##

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### In Your CI/CD

```yaml

# Scheduled pruning job
schedule:
  - every_week:
      - load_match_history.json
      - run_advanced_pruning
      - generate_report
      - archive_pruned
      - notify_team
```


### In Glyph Matching

```python
def match_glyph(glyph_id):
    # Use glyph normally
    use_glyph(glyph_id)

    # Track match (for pruning decisions)
    match_history[glyph_id] += 1

    # Periodic save
    if random.random() < 0.05:  # Save 5% of time
        save_match_history(match_history)
```


### In Factorial Expansion

```python

# Generate expansions
factorial_engine.generate_all_combinations()

# Apply pruning automatically
pruning_engine.evaluate_all_glyphs()

# Keep only survivors
survived = [c for c in candidates if not c.should_prune]

# Sync to JSON
factorial_engine.sync_to_json(survived)
```


##

## 📋 Data Structure

### PruneCandidate (Evaluation Result)

```python
@dataclass
class PruneCandidate:
    glyph_id: int
    glyph_name: str

   - Read `ADVANCED_PRUNING_GUIDE.md`
   - Check example in `factorial_with_advanced_pruning.py`

2. **Test on your data**

   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/saoriverse-console
   python3 emotional_os/glyphs/advanced_pruning_engine.py
   ```

3. **Check the report**

##

## 🎓 Key Principles

1. **Activation is everything** (30% weight)
   - What works in production matters most
   - Track actual usage

2. **Signal clarity prevents mediocrity** (25% weight)
   - Emotional glyphs must be clear
   - Ambiguous ones fade out

3. **Redundancy is about function** (20% weight)
   - Same role + same tone = redundant
   - Different tone = valuable

4. **Diversity is about palette** (15% weight)
   - Don't concentrate in one tone
   - Maintain full Saonyx spectrum

5. **System integrity is sacred** (10% weight)
   - Catalysts are protected
   - Reactions must work

##

## 💬 Support & Customization

The system is **fully customizable**:

```python

# Adjust weights
weights = {
    'signal_strength': 0.25,      # Change from 0.25
    'redundancy': 0.20,            # Change from 0.20
    'tone_diversity': 0.15,        # Change from 0.15
    'activation': 0.30,            # Change from 0.30 (currently highest)
    'reaction_participation': 0.10 # Change from 0.10
}

# Adjust thresholds
thresholds = {
    'critical_keep': 0.70,    # Change from 0.70
    'keep': 0.45,             # Change from 0.45
    'marginal': 0.25,         # Change from 0.25
}

# Adjust protection rules
protect_if = {
    'base_glyph': True,            # Protect first 64?
    'reaction_anchor': True,       # Protect catalysts?
    'high_signal': 0.70,           # Protect above this?
}
```


##
