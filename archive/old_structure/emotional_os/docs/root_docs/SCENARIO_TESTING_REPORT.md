## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENHANCEMENT

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. **Expand Gate 12 Keywords**
   - Add: transcend, enlighten, ultimate, divine, eternal, infinite, completion, mastery, god, cosmic
   - Current: transcendence, return, peace, eternal (partially working)
   - Impact: Will activate Gate 12 for transcendence-focused scenarios

2. **Enhance Keyword Extraction**
   - Add keywords for: vulnerability, sensuality, magnetism, embodiment, vitality, sexuality
   - Add: foundation, structure, grounding, stability (for Gate 4)
   - Add: flow, synchronicity, natural, rhythm (for Gate 11)
   - Impact: Better scenario matching across all gates

3. **Add Multi-Keyword Matching**
   - Current: Single keyword extraction
   - Proposed: Compound keyword phrases (e.g., "spiritual crisis" → identity + dissolution)
   - Impact: Better semantic matching

### Medium Priority

4. **Gate 4 (Foundation) Visibility**
   - Currently underutilized in scenarios
   - Recommendation: Add "foundation", "grounding", "structure", "stability" to keyword list

5. **Gate 6 (Sexuality/Vitality) Coverage**
   - Limited sexual/sensual energy matching
   - Recommendation: Add keywords: sensual, magnetism, embodied, aliveness, life force

6. **Gate 11 (Synchronicity) Connection**
   - Currently minimum coverage
   - Recommendation: Add keywords: flow, rhythm, synchronicity, timing, natural

### Long-Term (Enhancement)

7. **Phrase-Level Matching**
   - Current: Word-level keyword matching
   - Proposed: Phrase-level semantic analysis
   - Example: "losing my faith" → dissolution + foundation loss
   - Impact: More nuanced emotional territory navigation

8. **Ritual Sequence Optimization**
   - Ensure all 6 rituals activated in core scenarios
   - Consider scenario-specific ritual recommendations
   - Impact: More comprehensive emotional processing
