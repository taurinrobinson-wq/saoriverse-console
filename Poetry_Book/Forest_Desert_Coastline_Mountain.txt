Forest

You  
mythic green
Iyalawo
Mother mystery
canopy 
  priestess.

Your shade no comfort.  
  Forebodes,  
Fè atansyon
  Even the Bitty‑Bugga
Freeze! 
  At your warning glance.


Yet uncanny
  still  
you induce 
  my liturgy.

You urge me 
  to speak  
and I 
  chant you gladly.

Your branches 
  altar.  
Planks altered 
  laid bare,  
planed clean,  
  ready to build.

Your breeze sweetens,  
stirring 
  green breath.

Bugs, birds,  
webs, webbed feet,  
click, chirr, crack,  
tip tap toe cross your body  
They always belonged.

You are Mother BEarth  
at her most abundant.


Desert  

but not deserted.  
Warmed.  
Scorched, even.

I have found all your oases.  
Ache sees water  
where there is none.

Yet I share it
  with sand creatures  
Despite knowing  
  you built them for me.

You are palm frond,  
fondling the wind  
as it sways—
Blanched branches  
  yet rare softness  
in a place of bone.

I welcome your respite  
Though brief.

And I—  
I am camel,  
perfectly suited  
for your terrain,  
for thirst,  
Longing
  Hunts green wheat
     from white heat

Coastline

You are my rhythmic mistress.

I dance back 
  and forth  
water (pale)  
   sand (amber)
water (cool)
   sand (umber).

Castles built for washing  
tugged away

You toy with the grains.

I chase your foam  
scoop its salt-sweet into my mouth.

Gargle lime  
salty  
astringent.

You cure me  
of ails.


Mountain

You are 
Summit.

Air thin.  
Lung tightened.  
I climb 
  Unfazed.

Bonsai cling to your ribs,  
small fists  
hold on  
  to hollow 
    wind.

Your crown frozen  
Yet sun-kissed  
Cold fire.  
  Defiant.

Up here  
  Space is 
    whisper-thin.  
Thoughts flicker 
  with rationed breath  

You are mythic  
in your views.

From here  
  Laid bare
Future speaks
  Peaks seek to mount
Like chests  
  still rising.
