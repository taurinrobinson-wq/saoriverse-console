# Corelink System Architecture

## Overview

The Corelink system is the **emotional physics engine** of Velinor. It's not just lore—it's a mechanical substrate that explains why the world behaves as it does, why NPCs are disoriented, why glyphs matter, and why the player (and only the player) can restore coherence.

---

## The System: Pre-Collapse

**Before the collapse**, Corelink was a bidirectional emotional infrastructure:

- **Nodes**: Fixed beacons distributed across Velinor that broadcast and received emotional signals
- **Implants**: Neural interfaces in citizens' bodies that acted as antennae and emotional filters
- **Function**: Smoothed emotional turbulence across the population, creating collective emotional homeostasis
- **Effect**: Velhara was stable, coherent, orderly—a society in psychological equilibrium

This wasn't oppressive in the sense of explicit control. It was more like **emotional stereo speakers balanced at a comfortable volume**—you didn't notice it, and neither did anyone else. The system was just... how things worked.

## The Collapse: What Happened

When the core hub disconnected:

- **Nodes became isolated**: Each node kept broadcasting but lost the ability to receive signals from other nodes or the core
- **Signal became unidirectional**: Emotional broadcasts flooded outward with no feedback loop, no regulation, no rest
- **The system experienced infinite recursion**: Nodes began broadcasting their own incoherence back at themselves, amplifying distortion with each cycle
- **Implanted people became saturated**: Citizens with implants were flooded with unfiltered, unregulated emotional noise

This is why:
- People have fractured memories (cognitive overload)
- They experience disorientation and headaches near nodes (proximity to broadcast)
- They misremember or contradict each other (different nodes broadcasting conflicting emotional data)
- They feel drawn to certain places but afraid to approach (emotional echoes with no context)

---

## The Player: Why They're Different

The player was **too young to receive an implant** when the system collapsed. This makes them unique:

- **Unimplanted** = no direct neurological link to Corelink broadcasts
- **Less affected** = can approach nodes without the same cognitive overload implanted people experience
- **Natural investigator** = they're the only one who can enter chambers, experience the distortions, and survive them
- **Restoration agent** = as they clear chambers and restore coherence, the system begins broadcasting strong enough that *even non-implanted people* feel it

The player is not a hero. They're a **necessary accident**—the only person positioned to fix a system they never participated in.

## Coherence: The Game's Core Mechanic

**Coherence** is the state of the Corelink system. It ranges from 0 (complete fragmentation) to 7 (full restoration, one glyph per emotional domain).

### Coherence Levels

| Level | State | NPC Behavior | Signal Strength | Player Experience |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0 | **Fragmented** | Severe disorientation, fractured speech, contradictions | Chaotic, overwhelming | Heavy distortion, hallucinations feel hostile |
| 1 | **Glyph 1 cleared** | First echoes of clarity, some NPCs remember fragments | Slightly regulated | Distortions become navigable, patterns emerge |
| 2 | **Glyph 2 cleared** | NPCs begin to recognize each other's distortions | Two domains stable | Player feels signal even without implant |
| 3 | **Glyph 3 cleared** | Conversations become possible, shared memory fragments | Half-regulated | Chamber atmospheres become clearer, less chaotic |
| 4 | **Glyph 4 cleared** | NPCs remember events, ask questions | Four stable channels | Hallucinations become more symbolic |
| 5 | **Glyph 5 cleared** | Communities reform, collective memory stabilizes | Five domains coherent | System broadcasting clearly even to unimplanted |
| 6 | **Glyph 6 cleared** | NPCs begin to remember *why* things happened | Six domains restored | Chambers feel almost peaceful, distortions minimal |
| 7 | **All glyphs cleared** | Full restoration, NPCs remember the collapse and its cause | Full coherence | System broadcasts clearly, hallucinations become conversations |

### What Happens at Each Level

As coherence increases:

1. **Nodes stabilize** — broadcast becomes predictable instead of chaotic
2. **NPCs clarify** — their implants can now receive signals, creating two-way communication again
3. **Emotional distortions decrease** — the system regulates itself
4. **Chambers become legible** — what was hostile confusion becomes understandable emotional truth
5. **The player feels more** — as the system strengthens, even non-implanted people begin to feel its broadcast

---

## Nodes: The Seven Emotional Domains

Each node broadcasts the emotional signature of its domain. When isolated and unregulated, these become **distortion fields**—chambers filled with coherent hallucinations that reflect the domain's emotional nature.

The seven domains are:

1. **Covenant** — Connection, bonding, interdependence → Distortion: Overwhelming sense of separation and longing
2. **Resolve** — Determination, will, agency → Distortion: Paralysis, confusion about choice
3. **Accord** — Harmony, agreement, synchronization → Distortion: Dissonance, contradiction, conflict
4. **Verity** — Truth, clarity, knowing → Distortion: Lies, doubt, uncertainty
5. **Prism** — Perspective, understanding, interpretation → Distortion: Fragmented reality, multiple contradictory perceptions
6. **Anchor** — Stability, grounding, presence → Distortion: Groundlessness, drift, dissociation
7. **Ascendant** — Growth, transformation, becoming → Distortion: Stagnation, decay, entropy

Each domain's node is a separate chamber, and each chamber manifests a unique hallucination—a "Triglyph boss" or coherent distortion-entity that must be confronted and cleared to restore that domain's emotional signal.

---

## The Chambers: Physical Manifestation

When the player enters a chamber:

1. **They cross the node's broadcast threshold** — the emotional signal becomes overwhelming
2. **Their perception shifts** — the distortion field creates a shared hallucination
3. **The Triglyph manifestation appears** — a coherent entity born from the node's emotional incoherence
4. **Combat/confrontation occurs** — not physical violence, but emotional resolution (mechanics TBD)
5. **The glyph is discovered** — a symbol of the domain, which when activated restores that node
6. **Coherence increases by 1** — the domain's signal becomes bidirectional again
7. **The chamber transforms** — emotional distortion decreases, the hallucination stabilizes into something almost peaceful

---

## NPCs and Implants: How They're Affected

NPCs with implants experience Corelink's collapse as:

- **Cognitive saturation** — receiving emotional data with no way to filter or respond
- **Memory fragmentation** — overlapping broadcasts creating contradictory memories
- **Disorientation** — losing sense of what's real vs. what's broadcast
- **Emotional echoes** — feeling something without understanding why (it's a node broadcasting somewhere nearby)
- **Physical symptoms** — headaches, mild nausea, sense of being watched

The intensity depends on:
- **Implant strength** — some people have older implants, some newer; sensitivity varies
- **Distance to nodes** — closer = more intense distortion
- **Coherence level** — as the player restores glyphs, the signal becomes less chaotic

---

## The Player's Journey: Narrative Progression

As the player clears glyphs and coherence increases:

1. **Early chambers** feel alien and hostile—pure distortion
2. **Mid-game chambers** become navigable—patterns emerge, emotional logic becomes clearer
3. **Late chambers** feel almost introspective—the distortions become recognizable emotional states
4. **Final chamber** (the Endgame Chamber) is not a fight—it's a conversation with the Corelink system itself, now restored enough to communicate

By the endgame, the system isn't the enemy. It's a living infrastructure that broke and is slowly remembering itself through the player's actions.

## Integration Points

The Corelink system connects to:

- **Story**: Why Velinor collapsed, why NPCs are broken, what restoration means
- **Gameplay**: Chambers, progression, difficulty curve
- **Atmosphere**: Distortion effects, hallucinations, UI feedback
- **Dialogue**: NPC behavior changes based on coherence level
- **Mechanics**: Proximity detection, signal strength, hallucination rendering

Every system in the game should funnel back to: "How does this reflect the emotional state of Corelink at this coherence level?"
