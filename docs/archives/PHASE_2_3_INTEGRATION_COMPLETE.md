# Phase 2.3 Integration Complete ✅

**Date:** December 2, 2025
**Status:** FULLY INTEGRATED AND TESTED
**Test Results:** 262/262 PASSING (100%)

##

## What Was Accomplished

### Phase 2.3 Integration into Main Pipeline

Successfully wired the Repair Module (Phase 2.3) into the main response engine, creating an end-to-end correction detection and adaptive glyph selection system.

### Integration Scope

**main_response_engine.py** - 79 lines added for Phase 2.3 integration:

1. **Imports** (3 lines)
   - Added `RepairOrchestrator` and `GlyphCompositionContext` imports

2. **Session Initialization** (30 lines)
   - Initialize RepairOrchestrator per user (with Streamlit session state fallback)
   - Check for previous response and analyze for rejections
   - Detect rejection patterns and extract corrections
   - Record acceptance when user doesn't reject

3. **Glyph Override** (15 lines)
   - Pass `suggested_glyph_override` to compose_glyph_aware_response()
   - System uses better alternative when user rejects current glyph

4. **Response Recording** (31 lines)
   - After generating glyph-aware response, record it
   - Capture emotional state (tone, arousal, valence) and glyph used
   - Store in session state for next turn's repair detection

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Rejection Detection (Lines 47-56)

```python

# Before generating response, analyze for rejections
repair_analysis = repair_orchestrator.analyze_for_repair(user_input)

if repair_analysis.is_rejection and repair_analysis.suggested_alternative:
    suggested_glyph_override = repair_analysis.suggested_alternative
elif not repair_analysis.is_rejection:
    # Record acceptance of previous response
    if last_context:
        repair_orchestrator.record_acceptance(last_context)
```

### 2. Glyph Override (Line 180)

```python

# Pass suggested glyph to composer if available
brief_response, used_glyph = compose_glyph_aware_response(
    user_input,
    affect_analysis=affect_analysis,
    use_rotator=True,
    suggested_glyph=suggested_glyph_override,  # Phase 2.3
)
```

### 3. Response Recording (Lines 185-205)

```python

# Record the response and emotional state for next turn
if repair_orchestrator and used_glyph:
    context_record = GlyphCompositionContext(
        tone=tone or "neutral",
        arousal=arousal or 0.5,
        valence=valence or 0.0,
        glyph_name=used_glyph,
        user_id=ctx.get("user_id") or "anonymous"
    )
    repair_orchestrator.record_response(response_with_prefix)
    st.session_state["last_glyph_context"] = context_record
```

##

## Session State Management

The repair system uses Streamlit session state to maintain:

```python
st.session_state.repair_orchestrator      # RepairOrchestrator instance
st.session_state.last_glyph_context       # GlyphCompositionContext
```

This enables:

- Per-user learning across turns
- Persistent glyph effectiveness tracking
- Cross-turn correction feedback loops

##

## Example Workflow

### Turn 1: Initial Response

```
User: "I feel trapped and anxious"
↓
System: "That sounds like pressure building. What's bearing down on you?"
  - Used glyph: "Pressure"
  - Emotional state: tone=anxiety, arousal=0.8, valence=-0.6
  - Stored in session state for next turn
```

### Turn 2: User Rejects

```
User: "That's not it. It's more like breaking apart."
↓
Repair detects: is_rejection=true, type=explicit, correction="breaking"
↓
System learns: "Pressure" ineffective for this user's anxiety
↓
Suggested alternative: Next glyph to try
```

### Turn 3: System Adapts

```
User: "I'm still anxious"
↓
System retrieves: Best glyph for (anxiety, 0.8, -0.6)
↓
Uses: Alternative glyph that was more accepted
↓
Response: "I hear the [learned alternative]. What's happening?"
```

## Test Results

| Category | Tests | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Baseline (Phase 1-2.2.2) | 219 | ✅ All Passing |
| Repair Module (Phase 2.3) | 27 | ✅ All Passing |
| Repair Orchestrator (Phase 2.3) | 16 | ✅ All Passing |
| **TOTAL** | **262** | **✅ 100% PASSING** |

**Execution Time:** 2.46 seconds
**Regressions:** 0 (Zero)

##

## Code Quality

- ✅ **Syntax:** Valid Python (py_compile verified)
- ✅ **Imports:** All imports working correctly
- ✅ **Integration:** No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation:** Repair system falls back if unavailable
- ✅ **Session State:** Works with and without Streamlit
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Wrapped in try/except for safety

## Commits This Session

```
27a20ea feat: integrate repair module into main response pipeline (phase 2.3)
        - Added repair detection logic
        - Added response recording for learning
        - Wired glyph override capability
        - All tests passing, zero regressions
```

All changes pushed to: `chore/mypy-triage` branch

##

## What's Now Possible

1. **User Feedback Loop**
   - System detects when user rejects glyph suggestions
   - Learns which glyphs work best for each user

2. **Adaptive Responses**
   - Suggests alternative glyphs based on user feedback
   - Improves accuracy over time per user

3. **Preference Learning**
   - Tracks which emotional metaphors (glyphs) resonate
   - Customizes future responses based on history

4. **Correction Handling**
   - Detects explicit rejections ("not it", "nope")
   - Detects implicit corrections ("actually", "more like")
   - Extracts user's suggested alternatives

- [ ] Show effectiveness scores per glyph

### Phase 2.5: Advanced Learning

- [ ] Multi-dimensional glyph clustering
