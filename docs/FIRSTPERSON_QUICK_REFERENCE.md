# FirstPerson + Velinor: Quick Reference

## 🎯 Integration at a Glance

Your Velinor game now uses FirstPerson to make NPC dialogue **emotionally responsive**. Here's what
happens:

```text
```


You type: "I'm overwhelmed by all of this" ↓ FirstPerson analyzes:

- Tone: "heavy" (negative emotion)
- Theme: "general" (burden/overwhelm)
- Valence: -0.7 (quite negative)
- Intensity: 0.8 (strong emotion)
↓ NPC adapts response:
- Opening acknowledges weight: "I hear the weight in that"
- Connects to theme: "The burden can feel immense"
- Invites exploration: "What needs to be said about it?"

```



## 🧠 Emotional Analysis Components

### 1. **Tone** (How they're saying it)
| Tone | Indicators | NPC Opening |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **uplifting** | happy, joy, wonderful, amazing | "I feel that brightness too" |
| **heavy** | sad, angry, frustrated, hurt | "I hear the weight in that" |
| **reflective** | confused, uncertain, curious | "There's something to sit with there" |
| **curious** | questions, wondering, exploring | "Tell me more about that" |

### 2. **Valence** (-1 to +1)
- **< -0.5**: Strongly negative → NPC emphasizes listening
- **-0.5 to 0.5**: Neutral → NPC mirrors curiosity
- **> 0.5**: Strongly positive → NPC shares brightness

### 3. **Intensity** (0 to 1)
- **< 0.3**: Calm, quiet → NPC asks gentle questions
- **0.3-0.7**: Moderate → NPC engages directly
- **> 0.7**: Intense → NPC acknowledges weight/urgency

### 4. **Theme**
- **grief**: Loss, death, endings
- **joy**: Happiness, celebration, connection
- **general**: Everything else

## 📊 Memory & Patterns

FirstPerson tracks across turns:

### Conversation Memory
```text

```text
```


Turn 1: "I feel disconnected"     → Theme: general, Valence: -0.6 Turn 2: "It's like I've lost them"
→ Theme: grief, Valence: -0.8 Turn 3: "But maybe there's hope"  → Theme: grief, Valence: -0.1

→ Detects: 'grief' is recurring → Emotional trend: Improving (from -0.8 to -0.1)

```




### NPC Responds to Pattern

```text

```

Turn 3 NPC: "I'm noticing a shift in what you're saying.
What's helping you see this differently?"

```




## 💬 Response Generation

### Three-Part Structure

1. **Opening** (mirrors tone)
   - Heavy: "I hear the weight in that"
   - Uplifting: "I feel that brightness too"
   - Reflective: "There's something to sit with there"

2. **Middle** (acknowledges theme + memory)
   - Theme-specific: "Loss shapes us in ways words can't reach"
   - Memory-aware: "And I'm noticing grief keeps coming back to you"

3. **Closing** (invites deeper exploration)
   - High intensity: "What needs to be said about it?"
   - Low intensity: "What's sitting underneath that?"
   - Medium: "What would help you carry this?"

## 🛠 Code Integration Points

### In `velinor_app.py`

```python


## FirstPerson initialized on startup
st.session_state.firstperson_orchestrator = FirstPersonOrchestrator(...)

## Passed to game engine
orchestrator = VelinorTwineOrchestrator(
    first_person_module=firstperson_orchestrator,
    ...

```text

```

### In `velinor/engine/orchestrator.py`

```python


## Step 1: Analyze player input
player_analysis = self._summarize_player_intent(player_input, player_id)

## Returns: {emotional_tone, detected_theme, valence, intensity, memory_context}

## Step 2: Apply to NPC dialogue
npc_dialogue = self._generate_npc_dialogue( npc_name='Keeper', context=updated_state  # Contains
player_analysis

```text
```text

```

## 🎮 Real Example

**Game Scenario:** Meeting an NPC named Keeper

### Scenario 1: Heavy Emotional Weight

```


You: "Everything feels too heavy. I don't know if I can go on."

FirstPerson Analysis: { tone: 'heavy', theme: 'general', valence: -0.8, intensity: 0.9 }

Keeper's Response: "I hear the weight in that. The gravity of what you're carrying— I feel it too.
What needs to be said about it? Sometimes naming it

```text
```


### Scenario 2: Recurring Theme (After 3rd mention of loss)

```
You: "I keep coming back to what I've lost..."

FirstPerson Analysis:
{
  tone: 'heavy',
  theme: 'grief',
  valence: -0.7,
  intensity: 0.6,
  memory_context: {
    recurring_themes: ['grief'],
    emotional_trend: 'stable',
    num_turns: 5
  }
}

Keeper's Response:
"I hear the weight in that. And I'm noticing grief keeps coming
back to you—it's sitting heavy. That tells me something. What do
```text

```text
```


### Scenario 3: Emotional Improvement

```

You: "Maybe there's something I can learn from this pain..."

FirstPerson Analysis:
{
  tone: 'reflective',
  theme: 'grief',
  valence: -0.2,  ← Improved!
  intensity: 0.4,
  memory_context: {
    emotional_trend: 'improving'  ← Detected!
  }
}

Keeper's Response:
"There's something to sit with there. I'm also noticing a shift

```text

```

## 🚀 How to Use It

### Local Play

```bash


## Just run it—integration works automatically!

```text
```text

```

No configuration needed. FirstPerson analysis happens client-side.

### Observing the Analysis

The terminal shows debug info (if logging enabled):

```


[Player Input] "I'm struggling with loss" [FirstPerson] tone='heavy', theme='grief', valence=-0.7,
intensity=0.8

```text
```


### Customizing Responses

Edit `_generate_emotionally_aware_response()` in `orchestrator.py`:

```python

## Modify opening responses
response_openings = {
    'uplifting': ["Your custom uplifting response"],
    'heavy': ["Your custom heavy response"],
    ...
}

## Modify theme acknowledgments
theme_acknowledgments = {
    'grief': "Your custom grief acknowledgment",
    ...
```text

```text
```


## 📈 What Improves Player Experience

✨ **Personalized Responses**: NPCs don't repeat generic dialogue

✨ **Contextual Awareness**: References previous turns and themes

✨ **Emotional Attunement**: Tone matches player's emotional state

✨ **Pattern Recognition**: Notices when players struggle with same issue

✨ **Growth Tracking**: Acknowledges when emotional state improves

✨ **Immersive**: Feels like NPCs genuinely understand and care

## 🔄 Memory Tracking Examples

### Turn Tracking

```python

self.memory.record_turn(
    user_input="I feel lost",
    affect={valence: -0.7, intensity: 0.8, tone: 'heavy'},
    theme='general',
    glyph_name=None

```text

```

### Recurring Theme Detection

```python

Turn 1: "I miss them" → theme='general' Turn 2: "The loss keeps returning" → theme='grief' Turn 3:
"Grief is still with me" → theme='grief' (2nd occurrence)

## FirstPerson detects 'grief' is recurring:
memory.repeated_patterns = ['grief']

## Next NPC response includes:

```text
```text

```

### Emotional Trajectory

```python


Valence history: [-0.8, -0.7, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2] → Trend: 'improving'

NPC: "I'm also noticing a shift. What's helping?"

```
