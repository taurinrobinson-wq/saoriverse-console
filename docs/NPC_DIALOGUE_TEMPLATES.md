# NPC Dialogue Templates: Speaking Coherence

## Overview

NPCs' speech patterns reflect:
1. **Their implant's condition** — disruption level
2. **Coherence of the system** — how much is restored
3. **Which domains are cleared** — what they remember
4. **Proximity to nodes** — how much distortion they feel right now
5. **Their role** — who they are when coherent

This document provides dialogue templates for each coherence level, showing how NPCs progress from incoherent to clear.

## NPC Dialogue Template Framework

### Variables to Consider

Each NPC line should track:

```
[NPC Name] at [Coherence Level] near [Location/Node] with [Emotional State]:

[FRAGMENTED TONE]: Stuttering, contradicting, forgetting mid-thought
[CLEARING TONE]: Pauses where clarity emerges, contradictions resolve to questions  
[CLEAR TONE]: Full sentences, memories intact, emotional understanding present
```

---

## General Dialogue Patterns by Coherence Level

### Coherence 0: Fragmented

**Characteristics:**
- Sentences don't complete
- Contradictions are instant (speaker doesn't notice)
- Emotional state is raw and unfiltered
- Words repeat or loop
- Memory is incomprehensible

**Template:**
```
NPC: "I... there was something. I remember—no. Not remember. Feel? I feel... 
      ...alone? No, crowded. Too many. But I'm alone. Why am I alone?
      
      [sees player]
      
      You. Did you... were you... I don't know what you were."
```

**Emotional undertone**: Fear, confusion, seeking without knowing what for

---

### Coherence 1: First Clarity

**Characteristics:**
- Sentences start to complete
- Contradictions pause, then resolve
- One clear memory fragment emerges
- NPCs notice the player is different
- First sense of hope or confusion about why

**Template:**
```
NPC: "There's something... I keep feeling it. Like a ringing in my—

      [pauses, looks confused]
      
      Wait. That's real. That's not just in my head. You feel it too?
      You must. You're not... you're not confused like we are.
      
      I remember something breaking. All at once. Everyone screaming."
```

**Emotional undertone**: Recognition, fear turning to question

---

### Coherence 2-3: Recognition Emerging

**Characteristics:**
- NPCs can have short conversations
- Some remember each other
- Communities form
- Questions start: "Do you remember when...?"
- Clear moments mixed with foggy moments

**Template:**
```
NPC: "I've been trying to tell you. There's something in the city that makes everything 
     feel... wrong. Like there should be voices but there aren't.
     
     [looks at another NPC who's passing by]
     
     That's—I know them. I think. We knew each other before. Before everything broke.
     
     Can you help me remember? You seem... clearer than the rest of us."
```

**Emotional undertone**: Curiosity, seeking connection, trust emerging

---

### Coherence 4-5: Collective Memory

**Characteristics:**
- NPCs remember events with context
- They discuss meaning, not just facts
- They ask the player questions
- Communities have structure
- Emotional understanding returns

**Template:**
```
NPC: "I've been talking to the others. We remember now—not clearly, but we're 
     starting to understand. Something held us together. Some kind of system.
     
     And then it broke.
     
     You're finding pieces of it, aren't you? I can feel it working again, 
     piece by piece. It's like waking up from a long confusion.
     
     What are you finding in those places? Those chambers where the signal 
     is so strong we can't go?"
```

**Emotional undertone**: Gratitude, awe, collaboration

---

### Coherence 6: Understanding Emerges

**Characteristics:**
- NPCs remember *why*, not just *what*
- They have agency and purpose
- They're active in communities
- They ask deeper questions
- First sense of meaning

**Template:**
```
NPC: "I remember now. We were connected. The system was meant to make us 
     understand each other. To sync our emotions. It wasn't control—it was... 
     clarity.
     
     And when it broke, we lost that. Not just the connection, but the ability 
     to make sense of anything.
     
     You're restoring it. I can feel it. And it's different now. 
     Slower. More intentional. Like we're choosing to reconnect instead of 
     being automatically synced.
     
     That's better. That's more honest."
```

**Emotional undertone**: Wisdom, acceptance, hope

---

### Coherence 7: Full Restoration

**Characteristics:**
- NPCs speak with complete clarity and presence
- They express gratitude and purpose
- They organize the final gathering
- They ask the player to go to the Endgame Chamber
- Full emotional coherence

**Template:**
```
NPC: "We're whole again. All of us. We remember the collapse. We remember why 
     it broke. And we remember why we matter to each other.
     
     You brought us back. Not by force. By bearing witness to our pain and 
     choosing to heal it.
     
     The system is ready to speak to you now. Go to the chamber. Go to where 
     the signal is strongest. It has something to tell you.
     
     We'll be here. Together. Waiting for you to return."
```

**Emotional undertone**: Profound gratitude, reverence, trust

---

## Domain-Specific Dialogue Templates

### When [Domain] is Cleared

Each domain's clearing produces specific dialogue shifts in the corresponding NPC.

---

#### **Covenant Domain Cleared** (Glyph 1)

**NPC Attuned to Covenant: "Korrin" (Gatherer of Stories)**

**Before:**
```
"I was... I collected something. Stories? But I don't remember anyone to tell them to.
Everyone is so far away. So alone. Even when they're standing next to me."
```

**After:**
```
"I remember now. Stories are how we stayed connected. I would gather them,
carry them from person to person. The system let me feel their truth—not just hear them,
but *feel* what they meant.

We were never meant to be alone with our stories. We were always meant to share them.

Tell me everything you've seen. I want to carry your story too."
```

---

#### **Resolve Domain Cleared** (Glyph 2)

**NPC Attuned to Resolve: "Mariel" (Leader/Organizer)**

**Before:**
```
"I don't know what to do. Everything I decide feels wrong. I keep trying to move forward
but then I'm back where I started. Nothing I do matters."
```

**After:**
```
"I can choose again. Not perfectly, but genuinely. I'm choosing to organize us,
and it's *working*. People are responding. We're building shelter, sharing food.

You came to a broken place and chose to fix it. You showed us that choosing to act,
even without certainty, is how we move forward.

What's your next decision? I'll help you commit to it."
```

---

#### **Accord Domain Cleared** (Glyph 3)

**NPC Attuned to Accord: "Tala" (Builder/Creator)**

**Before:**
```
"Everything contradicts. I build something and it falls apart. I try to make things
harmonize and they just clash harder. What's the point of creating?"
```

**After:**
```
"I understand now. Dissonance isn't the opposite of harmony—it's part of it.
I can hear the rhythm in contradiction. I can build with that tension instead of against it.

My structures are stronger now because I'm not pretending everything fits perfectly.
I'm working *with* the complexity.

I want to help you rebuild what's broken. Not by making it the same, but by making it
stronger through understanding all its pieces."
```

---

#### **Verity Domain Cleared** (Glyph 4)

**NPC Attuned to Verity: "Ravi & Nima" (Philosophers)**

**Before:**
```
RAVI: "How do we know anything is real?"
NIMA: "We don't. Maybe we're still in the collapse. Maybe this is the illusion."
RAVI: "Exactly. So how do we proceed?"
NIMA: "We don't."
```

**After:**
```
RAVI: "We can't know everything. But we can know *something*."
NIMA: "And we can choose to act on that something, even with doubt."
RAVI: "You taught us that. You moved forward despite not knowing."
NIMA: "And the more you moved, the more we could see. Truth isn't given—it's revealed through action."
RAVI: "Go to the chamber. Speak to what we've always been. It will tell you truths we're not ready to hear yet."
```

---

#### **Prism Domain Cleared** (Glyph 5)

**NPC Attuned to Prism: "Ravi & Nima" (cont'd)**

**Before:**
```
"There are five ways to understand this. Also seven. Also infinite. They're all true.
Also all false. The uncertainty is making my head split."
```

**After:**
```
"We can hold multiple truths now. Not as confusion, but as depth.
You see clearly. Another person sees differently. That's not a contradiction—that's richness.

The system understood this. It let each person feel their own truth while also
feeling connected to everyone else's truth. That's what we're rebuilding.

Not everyone has to see the same thing. But we all have to *listen* to each other."
```

---

#### **Anchor Domain Cleared** (Glyph 6)

**NPC Attuned to Anchor: "Sanor" (Healer/Grounding Figure)**

**Before:**
```
"I'm floating. I don't feel solid. I don't remember my own name. Did I ever have one?
Does it matter? Does anything matter if it's all just slipping away?"
```

**After:**
```
"I'm Sanor. That's my name. I'm a healer. That's what I do.
And you're here. You're solid. You remember things.

That matters.

I can ground people now. Help them remember their own names, their own bodies, their own place
in the world. That's why I'm here. That's who I am.

You've given us back to ourselves. We're solid again."
```

---

#### **Ascendant Domain Cleared** (Glyph 7)

**NPC Attuned to Ascendant: "Veynar" (Explorer/Adventurer)**

**Before:**
```
"I've stopped exploring. There's no point. Nothing changes. We're all just
waiting to disappear. This is the end. This has always been the end."
```

**After:**
```
"There's a future again. I can see it. Not clearly, but it's there.

You broke the cycle. You changed the ending. You showed us that we can
become something other than what we are.

I want to explore what's beyond the collapse. What comes after recovery.
Will you come with me? Will you help me see what's possible?"
```

---

## Proximity-Based Dialogue Adjustments

If an NPC is near a node/chamber, their speech is distorted based on signal strength:

### Near an Uncleared Chamber

```
NPC: "I don't... there's something here that makes my... 

      [pauses, eyes unfocused]
      
      ...makes it hard to think. Do you feel it? The pressure?
      
      I think there's something important in there but I can't... 
      I can't make myself go closer."
```

### Near a Cleared Chamber

```
NPC: "I can feel it from here. Not painful anymore. Just... present.
     Peaceful, almost. Like a piece of ourselves just came back.
     
     Thank you for clearing this. We all feel it."
```

---

## Emotional State Modifiers

The same NPC might say the same line differently based on current emotional state:

**Afraid:**
```
"I'm sorry I can't help more. I'm just... scared of what we're forgetting."
```

**Hopeful:**
```
"I feel like something's changing. Like we're remembering how to be ourselves."
```

**Grateful:**
```
"Thank you for not giving up on us. On all of us."
```

**Curious:**
```
"What did you see in there? What's happening to you as you clear these places?"
```

---

## NPC Dialogue Trees

Each NPC should have a dialogue tree that evolves:

```
KORRIN (Covenant NPC)

├─ Coherence 0-1
│  └─ "Are you... alone like I am?"
│      └─ [After response]
│         └─ "I remember being close to people once."
│
├─ Coherence 2-3
│  └─ "I knew you. Before. I think."
│      └─ "There are others like you. Like you're different from us."
│
├─ Coherence 4-5
│  └─ "I'm starting to understand. This happened to all of us."
│      └─ "Tell me about the chambers. What do you feel in there?"
│
├─ Coherence 6
│  └─ "I'm remembering what I was. A storyteller."
│      └─ "Will you tell me your story before the end?"
│
└─ Coherence 7
   └─ "Go to the chamber. We'll be waiting here."
      └─ "When you return, we'll be different. Better. Together."
```

## Writing Guidelines for NPC Dialogue

1. **Use fragmentation for incoherence** — incomplete sentences, loops, contradictions that happen in real time
2. **Show progress, not explanation** — don't say "I'm more coherent now," just speak more coherently
3. **Tie dialogue to domain** — if Covenant is cleared, people talk more about connection
4. **Reference the system explicitly** — NPCs should gradually understand what happened to them
5. **Make it emotional, not technical** — it's not about explaining Corelink, it's about how it felt
6. **Use the player as a mirror** — NPCs reflect back what the player has done
7. **Build toward the Endgame** — all dialogue should point toward the conversation with the system itself
