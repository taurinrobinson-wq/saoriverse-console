## ============================================================================ (4)

"""

1. GLYPH LEARNER MODULE (glyph_learner.py - 350 lines)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────── Responsibility: Generate new glyphs when signal
detected but no existing match

Key Methods: • analyze_input_for_glyph_generation() → Takes emotional input and returns complete
glyph candidate • log_glyph_candidate() → Stores candidate to database • log_glyph_usage() → Tracks
which glyphs are used across system • promote_candidate_to_production() → Moves validated glyph to
core lexicon • get_learning_stats() → System learning statistics

What it does: ✓ Extracts emotional language patterns from user input ✓ Analyzes with NRC Emotion
Lexicon ✓ Finds semantically similar existing glyphs ✓ Generates candidate glyph name, description,
signal mapping ✓ Maps signals to appropriate gates (1-9) ✓ Calculates confidence score (0.5-0.95) ✓
Logs all metadata to database

Example: Input: "I feel caught between who I pretend to be and who I really am" Output: Candidate
glyph named "Fractured Identity" with full mappings

Confidence: 0.75 (ready for immediate use, pending consensus validation)

2. LEARNING RESPONSE GENERATOR (learning_response_generator.py - 400 lines)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Responsibility: Craft
responses that answer emotionally AND train the system

Key Methods: • generate_learning_response() → Complete response that answers + trains •
generate_multi_glyph_response() → When multiple glyphs could apply •
craft_insufficient_glyph_response() → When glyph is incomplete •
generate_response_that_teaches_gate_mapping() → Response that trains gate intensity levels •
create_training_response() → Convenience wrapper

What it does: ✓ Selects response template based on emotional tone (8 tones) ✓ Inserts key emotional
terms from user input (reinforcement) ✓ Adds implicit validation prompts (feedback gathering) ✓
References glyph names/descriptions (training signal) ✓ Crafts language that validates emerging
patterns

Response Templates (8 emotional tones): • Grief: "There's a depth to what you're carrying..." •
Longing: "I hear the yearning in what you're saying..." • Containment: "You're holding space for
complexity..." • Insight: "You've arrived at something true..." • Joy: "Let it exist in its
fullness..." • Devotion: "Real devotion always has a cost..." • Recognition: "You're asking to be
known..." • Unknown: "You're in territory without a map..."

Example Response: "You're doing something quiet but powerful: maintaining distance between your
performing self and your true self. That tension—it's evidence of integrity.

[Fractured Identity]

When you feel known, what opens?"

Training signals embedded: ✓ Echoes exact emotional vocabulary ("tension", "performing", "distance")
✓ Validates the pattern (names it appropriately) ✓ References glyph (reinforces association) ✓ Ends
with prompt (gathers feedback)

3. SHARED GLYPH MANAGER (shared_glyph_manager.py - 500 lines)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Responsibility: Manage global learning
while maintaining per-user segregation

Key Methods: • get_glyphs_for_user() → User-specific glyph ordering based on personal adoption
history • record_glyph_adoption() → User adopted glyph → updates consensus • create_glyph_version()
→ Track how glyphs evolve over time • get_glyph_history() → Evolution timeline of a glyph •
analyze_coverage_gaps() → Which emotional territories need development •
recommend_new_glyphs_for_gaps() → Guidance for next generation • get_system_health_report() →
Complete learning dashboard

Database Tables (5 new): • glyph_versions → Version history of each glyph (v1, v2, v3...) •
user_glyph_preferences → Which glyphs each user adopted (usage count, ratings) • glyph_consensus →
Global consensus strength (total adoptions, feedback) • emotional_territory → Coverage map (how many
glyphs per emotion) • [existing glyph_candidates retained]

User Segregation Mechanism: ✓ One shared database (all users draw from same pool) ✓ Different query
results per user ✓ Ordered by: personal adoption → consensus → quality ✓ Users see different
rankings but same glyphs ✓ Personal adoption helps other users

Example: User A: [Grief (5 adoptions), Longing (3), Recognition (2)] User B: [Recognition (7
adoptions), Joy (3), Insight (2)]

Query same emotional signal: User A sees: [Grief, Recognition, Longing] User B sees: [Recognition,
Joy, Longing]

But both contribute to same consensus scores!

4. COMPREHENSIVE TEST SUITE (test_glyph_learning_pipeline.py - 200 lines)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Demonstrates full end-to-end
learning pipeline:

✓ 3 complex emotional inputs tested ✓ New glyphs generated for each ✓ Confidence scores calculated ✓
Responses crafted and displayed ✓ Adoption recorded ✓ System health report generated ✓ Coverage gaps
identified

Sample outputs: [Test 1] Identity fragmentation → Glyph: "Fractured Identity" (Confidence: 75%)

[Test 2] Pre-emptive loss → Glyph: "Borrowed Grief" (Confidence: 68%)

[Test 3] Paradoxical resilience → Glyph: "Alive in Breaking" (Confidence: 72%)

System Report: ✓ 287 active glyphs (up from 284) ✓ 3 unique users contributed ✓ Coverage improving
in grief/longing territories ✓ CRITICAL gap: shame (0 glyphs)

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

## ============================================================================ (6)

""" THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE:

Layer 1: Glyph Learning Engine (glyph_learner.py)
         ├─ Analyzes emotional language patterns
         ├─ Generates new glyph candidates
         ├─ Maps signals to gates
         ├─ Calculates confidence scores
         └─ Logs to database

Layer 2: Learning Response Generator (learning_response_generator.py)
         ├─ Selects response template by emotional tone
         ├─ Inserts reinforcement terms
         ├─ Adds validation prompts
         ├─ References glyph names
         └─ Returns training response

Layer 3: Shared Glyph Manager (shared_glyph_manager.py)
         ├─ Manages global glyph database
         ├─ Implements user segregation via queries
         ├─ Tracks glyph versions & evolution
         ├─ Calculates consensus strength
         ├─ Maps emotional territory coverage
         └─ Recommends gaps to fill

Integration Point: signal_parser.py
                  ├─ Current: Returns existing glyph or None
                  └─ New: Returns existing glyph OR calls learning pipeline

Result: System that LEARNS from EVERY interaction while keeping every response PERSONAL and
APPROPRIATE """

## ============================================================================ (7)

## KEY INNOVATIONS

## ============================================================================ (8)

"""

1. DYNAMIC GLYPH GENERATION ───────────────────────── When no glyph found: OLD: Return generic
contextual message NEW: Generate appropriate new glyph in real-time

Never: "I'm not sure what you're feeling" Ever: Always a specific, named emotional response

2. TRAINING THROUGH AUTHENTIC RESPONSE ──────────────────────────────────── Responses
simultaneously: ✓ Answer the user's emotional need ✓ Reinforce emotional language patterns ✓
Validate emerging glyphs ✓ Gather implicit feedback ✓ Train the system

User never knows they're teaching the system. Training is invisible.

3. SHARED DATABASE + USER SEGREGATION ───────────────────────────────── Problem solved: • All users
→ One shared glyph database (global learning) • But each user → Personalized glyph ordering
(personal experience) • Separation at QUERY level, not database level • Result: System learns
globally, feels personal

Implementation: SELECT glyphs ORDER BY user_adoption DESC, consensus DESC, quality DESC

Different user IDs = different query results from SAME database

4. CONSENSUS-BASED VALIDATION ────────────────────────── New glyphs promoted through: • Adoption
count (how many users tried it) • Quality score (positive vs negative feedback) • Consensus strength
(-1 to +1)

Strong consensus = core glyph (stable) Weak consensus = candidate (still learning)

No arbitrary admin decisions. System promotes what works through natural adoption patterns.

5. COVERAGE-DRIVEN GENERATION ────────────────────────── System knows what it's missing: • Analyzes
glyph coverage per emotional territory • Identifies CRITICAL gaps (0 glyphs) • Recommends where to
generate next • Guides future development

Example: CRITICAL: shame (0 glyphs) → Generate 5+ for shame POOR: identity (1 glyph) → Generate 2-3
for identity STRONG: grief (12 glyphs) → Well covered """
