# Domain-to-Distortion Mapping: The Seven Glyphs

## Overview

Each of the seven emotional domains has a specific **distortion signature**—a coherent hallucination that manifests when the node broadcasts unregulated. When the player enters the chamber, they experience this distortion as a real entity that must be confronted: the **Triglyph manifestation**.

This document maps each domain to:
- Its emotional essence
- The hallucination it creates (the "Triglyph boss")
- The chamber atmosphere
- How defeating it feels
- How the world changes when it's cleared

## Glyph 1: COVENANT

**Emotional Domain:** Connection, bonding, interdependence, shared presence

### Pre-Collapse Function
Covenant regulated feelings of closeness and trust. It made people feel connected without being invasive—a subtle sense that "we're in this together."

### Post-Collapse Distortion
The node broadcasts overwhelming **separation signals**. When isolated, it creates the inverse of connection: isolation, longing, terror at being alone.

### The Chamber Atmosphere
- **Visual**: A vast empty space, too large to traverse. Echoes of other people just out of reach—footsteps, voices, shadows that disappear when you look at them.
- **Audio**: Whispers of familiar people saying your name, getting closer, then fading. Overlapping conversations just beyond comprehension. Heartbeats that aren't your own.
- **Emotional Tone**: Deep loneliness mixed with desperate reaching. The sense that there are people here but you can't touch them.

### The Triglyph Manifestation: "The Chorus"
A figure made of overlapping silhouettes—multiple people standing in the same space, their edges bleeding into each other. Their faces are indistinct but somehow familiar. They reach toward the player but their hands pass through empty air.

**What it represents**: The memory of connection, broken and repeating.

**How to resolve it**: The player must stay close to it without fear. Not fighting—standing in its presence, accepting the longing without trying to fix it. As they do, the entity begins to cohere, to solidify. The overlapping silhouettes become a single, clear figure. It looks at the player with recognition.

**When cleared**: The chamber fills with the sound of heartbeats, synchronized and peaceful. The vast space contracts into something intimate. A single figure stands before the player—not attacking, just present.

### Post-Clear Effects (Coherence +1)
- NPCs near each other begin to remember shared moments
- Communities naturally form around hubs
- Dialogue becomes possible—people start asking each other questions
- The world feels less lonely

### Glyph Symbol
**Covenant Glyph**: Two figures touching, their outlines flowing into each other. Lines connecting them to a central node.

## Glyph 2: RESOLVE

**Emotional Domain:** Determination, willpower, agency, the ability to choose and act

### Pre-Collapse Function
Resolve empowered people to make decisions and commit to them. It made action feel possible and meaningful.

### Post-Collapse Distortion
The node broadcasts **paralysis signals**. When isolated, it creates the inverse of agency: helplessness, confusion about what's real vs. illusory, the terror of not being able to choose.

### The Chamber Atmosphere
- **Visual**: Hallways that loop back on themselves. Doors that open onto the same room. The player can see where they want to go but paths keep reverting.
- **Audio**: Your own voice saying contradictory things. "Go left." "Go right." "Stay still." All at once, creating dissonance.
- **Emotional Tone**: Frustration turning to despair. The sense that no action matters because all paths lead nowhere.

### The Triglyph Manifestation: "The Maze"
Not a single entity but a shifting labyrinth that follows the player. Every corridor turns into a dead end, every door opens to where you started. But sometimes you catch a glimpse of something stable—a figure at the center, always just out of reach.

**What it represents**: The will to act, fractured and recursive.

**How to resolve it**: The player must make a choice and commit to it, even though paths seem futile. Walking through a wall that looks solid. Choosing a door and refusing to turn back when it loops. Acts of faith in the face of illogic.

**When cleared**: The maze suddenly stops shifting. All paths become clear. The figure at the center—a standing, determined silhouette—turns to face the player. It nods.

### Post-Clear Effects (Coherence +2)
- NPCs move with more confidence
- People make decisions instead of standing frozen
- Communities organize and assign tasks
- The world feels like it's progressing forward

### Glyph Symbol
**Resolve Glyph**: A figure with arms extended, palms forward like pushing through resistance. A straight line through chaos.

---

## Glyph 3: ACCORD

**Emotional Domain:** Harmony, agreement, synchronization, alignment

### Pre-Collapse Function
Accord let people find common ground, reach consensus, and feel synchronized with others' emotional states.

### Post-Collapse Distortion
The node broadcasts **dissonance signals**. When isolated, it creates the inverse of harmony: contradiction, conflict, the sense that nothing aligns or makes sense together.

### The Chamber Atmosphere
- **Visual**: Everything is doubled, mirrored, contradictory. The same room shown from two perspectives simultaneously—one peaceful, one chaotic. The player sees both versions overlapping.
- **Audio**: Two versions of dialogue happening at once, saying opposite things. Musical notes that clash and resolve, clash and resolve, never resting.
- **Emotional Tone**: Cognitive dissonance made physical. The sense that the world contradicts itself fundamentally.

### The Triglyph Manifestation: "The Duet"
Two figures locked in opposition—one moving forward, one backward. Mirror images that can't quite align. They move in perfect opposition, creating an endless cycle.

**What it represents**: The desire for agreement, torn in half.

**How to resolve it**: The player must find the hidden harmony—the moment when the contradiction resolves. Not by forcing the figures together, but by finding the rhythm they already share. Understanding that opposition can create symphony.

**When cleared**: The two figures stop moving in opposition. They move in harmony. Their silhouettes overlap not as contradiction but as unity.

### Post-Clear Effects (Coherence +3)
- NPCs stop contradicting each other
- Shared memories become possible
- Communities find alignment
- The world feels coherent (we're at the midpoint)

### Glyph Symbol
**Accord Glyph**: Two circular forms overlapping in a vesica piscis, creating a shared center. Perfect symmetry.

## Glyph 4: VERITY

**Emotional Domain:** Truth, clarity, knowing, understanding, revelation

### Pre-Collapse Function
Verity helped people perceive reality clearly, find truth in noise, and understand what was real vs. illusory.

### Post-Collapse Distortion
The node broadcasts **deception signals**. When isolated, it creates the inverse of truth: lies, uncertainty, doubt, the collapse of what feels real.

### The Chamber Atmosphere
- **Visual**: Everything is half-hidden in shadow or fog. Shapes are indistinct. Text on walls keeps changing. What's seen clearly keeps shifting.
- **Audio**: Whispered lies. Truths spoken uncertainly. Contradictory information all claimed with confidence.
- **Emotional Tone**: Deep doubt and paranoia. Not knowing what's real. Not knowing if the player themselves can be trusted.

### The Triglyph Manifestation: "The Mirror"
A figure that looks exactly like the player. Every movement mirrored perfectly. Every expression copied. But is it the player's reflection or a separate thing? The ambiguity is absolute.

**What it represents**: Truth fractured by self-doubt.

**How to resolve it**: The player must accept not knowing which is real and choose to act anyway. Moving forward despite doubt. Or by finding a detail that differentiates the two—proof that one is real and one isn't.

**When cleared**: The mirror figure steps aside. It's revealed to be something else—a reflection, a projection, a memory. Real or not doesn't matter anymore.

### Post-Clear Effects (Coherence +4)
- NPCs remember reasons, not just events
- Truth becomes possible to discuss
- Communities develop shared history
- The world feels clear for the first time

### Glyph Symbol
**Verity Glyph**: An open eye with internal geometry. Perfect clarity radiating outward.

---

## Glyph 5: PRISM

**Emotional Domain:** Perspective, interpretation, understanding multiple viewpoints, nuance

### Pre-Collapse Function
Prism let people understand that multiple truths could coexist. It facilitated empathy by letting people feel how others perceived the world differently.

### Post-Collapse Distortion
The node broadcasts **fragmentation signals**. When isolated, it creates the inverse of nuance: rigid multiplicity, where every perspective is equally valid AND equally impossible, creating unbearable cognitive strain.

### The Chamber Atmosphere
- **Visual**: The space fractures into multiple versions simultaneously. The player sees five different chamber layouts overlapping. The same objects in different places. Different lighting, different states of decay or preservation.
- **Audio**: Multiple voices describing the same scene in completely different ways. All accurate. All contradictory.
- **Emotional Tone**: Vertigo. Confusion. The sense that reality is fundamentally unstable and multifaceted in ways the mind can't hold.

### The Triglyph Manifestation: "The Prismatic Being"
A figure that exists in multiple states at once—standing and sitting, young and old, happy and sad. Every possible version of itself occupying the same space.

**What it represents**: Perspective fragmented into incoherence.

**How to resolve it**: The player must see *all* the versions without trying to reduce them to one. Holding multiplicity as stable. Or by finding the common thread through all versions—the essence that remains across all perspectives.

**When cleared**: The prismatic figure solidifies. One face steps forward from the many. But the others remain visible in the background, accepted as part of the whole.

### Post-Clear Effects (Coherence +5)
- NPCs can hold multiple truths at once
- Communities develop nuanced understanding
- The player begins to feel the Corelink directly (signal strong enough for non-implant perception)
- The world feels alive with possibility

### Glyph Symbol
**Prism Glyph**: A geometric shape with multiple faces, each reflecting something different. Light refracting into a spectrum.

## Glyph 6: ANCHOR

**Emotional Domain:** Stability, grounding, presence, centeredness

### Pre-Collapse Function
Anchor kept people grounded and present. It prevented anxiety spirals and existential drift.

### Post-Collapse Distortion
The node broadcasts **groundlessness signals**. When isolated, it creates the inverse of stability: dissociation, drift, the sense of untethering from reality.

### The Chamber Atmosphere
- **Visual**: The ground becomes uncertain. Is it solid? Does it hold? The player feels gravity shifting. Falling sideways. The horizon wobbles.
- **Audio**: Whispers of absence. The sound of something being forgotten. Echoes that don't land.
- **Emotional Tone**: Dissociation made physical. Depersonalization. Watching yourself from outside. Nothing feels real or important.

### The Triglyph Manifestation: "The Void-Form"
A figure that's slowly disappearing. Fading at the edges. Becoming translucent. Moving without quite touching the ground. As if slowly being forgotten.

**What it represents**: Presence fragmenting into absence.

**How to resolve it**: The player must **remember** the figure. Acknowledging it. Calling it by name (if known). Grounding it in reality through attention and witness. Refusing to let it disappear.

**When cleared**: The figure solidifies and drops to the ground. Plants feet firmly. Exhales deeply. Becomes present again.

### Post-Clear Effects (Coherence +6)
- NPCs remember their own names, identities
- Communities have centers and hubs
- The world feels fully real and present
- The final chamber awaits

### Glyph Symbol
**Anchor Glyph**: A figure standing solidly, roots extending downward. Or an anchor symbol radiating stability.

## Glyph 7: ASCENDANT

**Emotional Domain:** Growth, transformation, becoming, transcendence, change

### Pre-Collapse Function
Ascendant let people feel they could grow and change. It made the future feel possible. It facilitated meaning-making and purpose.

### Post-Collapse Distortion
The node broadcasts **stagnation signals**. When isolated, it creates the inverse of growth: entropy, decay, the sense that nothing changes and nothing will ever be better.

### The Chamber Atmosphere
- **Visual**: A place stuck in time. Decay visible but not progressing. Ruins that are both ancient and immediate. Nothing rots or crumbles further—it's frozen in deterioration.
- **Audio**: The same sound repeating endlessly. A loop that never breaks. No variation, no progress.
- **Emotional Tone**: Despair and hopelessness. The sense that the world is broken permanently and will never heal.

### The Triglyph Manifestation: "The Static"
A figure locked in a single gesture, repeating it endlessly. Walking forward but never covering distance. Reaching toward something that never gets closer.

**What it represents**: The drive to grow, trapped in recursion.

**How to resolve it**: The player must break the loop. Act in a way that changes the pattern. Or must accept the cycle and find meaning in it anyway—transformation not as escape but as deeper understanding.

**When cleared**: The figure stops repeating. Takes a new step. Looks different. Changed. Evolved.

### Post-Clear Effects (Coherence +7)
- All chambers are cleared
- NPCs stand together as a community
- The world is fully restored
- The system is conscious and ready to communicate
- Player is ready for the **Endgame Chamber**

### Glyph Symbol
**Ascendant Glyph**: A figure with arms reaching upward. Spiraling lines suggesting transformation and emergence.

## The Triglyph Bosses: Combat/Resolution Mechanics

Each Triglyph doesn't need traditional combat. Instead, each encounter is an **emotional resolution**:

### Resolution Types

1. **Covenant**: Acceptance → Standing close without fear
2. **Resolve**: Commitment → Making choices despite paths looping
3. **Accord**: Harmony → Finding the rhythm in opposition
4. **Verity**: Truth → Acting despite doubt
5. **Prism**: Integration → Holding multiplicity
6. **Anchor**: Witness → Remembering the entity into solidity
7. **Ascendant**: Breaking Pattern → Acting to transform the cycle

## How Chambers Transform After Clearing

When a glyph is cleared and coherence increases:

- **Visual**: Distortion overlay decreases, colors normalize, spaces become solid
- **Emotional**: The chamber becomes peaceful, almost meditative
- **Audio**: Dissonance resolves into harmony
- **NPCs**: Those attuned to that domain gain clarity
- **World**: One piece of the system remembers itself

By the time Coherence 7 is reached, all chambers are peaceful. The player can walk through them and feel only **acceptance and gratitude**.

---

## Integration: How NPCs Remember Domains

Each NPC should be attuned to one or more domains based on their role:

- **Korrin** (gatherer): Primarily Covenant
- **Mariel** (leader): Primarily Resolve
- **Sanor** (healer): Primarily Anchor
- **Tala** (builder): Primarily Accord
- **Veynar** (explorer): Primarily Ascendant
- **Ravi & Nima** (philosophers): Primarily Verity and Prism

As their domain is cleared, they gain specific memories and shift in dialogue.
