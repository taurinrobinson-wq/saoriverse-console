# Voice Interface Dependencies
# For Sprints 1-4: Audio pipeline, STT, TTS, Prosody Planning

# Speech Recognition (Local STT)
faster-whisper>=0.10.0  # Faster Whisper implementation (CPU-optimized)
# Download size: ~140MB for "base" model (one-time download)
# Runtime: ~100ms per 10-second audio clip on CPU

# Audio Processing
librosa>=0.10.0  # Audio feature extraction (pitch, energy, speech rate)
soundfile>=0.12.0  # WAV/audio file I/O
scipy>=1.11.0  # Signal processing (VAD, filtering)

# Text-to-Speech (TTS) - Streaming
TTS>=0.21.0  # Coqui TTS for high-quality voice synthesis
# Models are downloaded on first use (~200MB for English)
# Supports streaming/incremental synthesis
# Note: TTS can be CPU-intensive; consider optional GPU support

# Audio Utilities
pydub>=0.25.0  # Audio format conversion
numpy>=1.24.0  # Numerical operations
matplotlib>=3.7.0  # Visualization (waveforms, spectrograms)

# Streamlit Audio Components (built-in, but good to explicitly note)
# st.audio_input() and st.camera_input() are built into Streamlit
# No additional package needed - works via browser WebAPI

# Optional: GPU acceleration for TTS (if user has CUDA)
# torch>=2.0.0  # Uncomment for GPU support
# torchaudio>=2.0.0

# Optional: Advanced noise suppression
# noisereduce>=2.0.0  # Optional, for better audio preprocessing
