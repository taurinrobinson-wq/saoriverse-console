## What's Working Now

✅ **Trait tracking**: Records and patterns choices ✅ **Coherence calculation**: Measures emotional
consistency ✅ **NPC compatibility**: Maps personality to player traits ✅ **Pattern recognition**:
Identifies primary/secondary traits ✅ **Test harness**: Validates all systems

---

## What's Not Yet Connected

❌ **Orchestrator integration**: Trait system not yet in main game loop ❌ **Marketplace scene**:
Design done, implementation not started ❌ **Streamlit UI**: No trait display yet ❌ **Dialogue
mapping**: Choices not yet tagged with traits ❌ **Path gating**: Coherence doesn't lock dialogue
paths yet ❌ **Web UI**: Next.js skeleton still empty ❌ **API layer**: No endpoints yet

## Key Implementation Rules

1. **Patterns over individual choices**: Look at 5-10 recent choices 2. **Coherence is
consequence**: Inconsistent players face suspicion 3. **People matter more than mechanics**: NPCs
are individuals with preferences 4. **Authenticity rewards**: High coherence unlocks deeper
interactions 5. **Multiple valid paths**: Don't punish contradictory players, just notice
