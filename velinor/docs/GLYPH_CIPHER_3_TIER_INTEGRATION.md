# 🌑 Complete Glyph-to-Cipher Integration (3-Tier System)

## Status: Ready for Implementation

I've scanned the complete glyph ecosystem and built the integration architecture to handle all three tiers:

### ✅ What I Found

**Tier 1: Base Glyphs (75)**
- Source: `Glyph_Organizer.json`
- Structure: Rich JSON with NPC, location, storyline, REMNANTS integration, player choices, images
- Domain categories: Collapse, Sovereignty, Ache, Presence, Joy, Trust, Legacy

**Tier 2: Intermediate Fragments (36)**
- Source: `Glyph_Fragments.csv`
- Structure: NPC-specific ability progression steps
- Mechanics: Grant +10 to +20 to REMNANTS traits
- Purpose: Teach mechanics without full glyph unlock

**Tier 3: Transcendence/Fusion Glyphs (7)**
- Source: `Glyph_Transcendence.csv`
- Structure: Boss encounters requiring multiple base glyphs
- Mechanics: Combine 4-8 glyphs to unlock fusion bosses
- Purpose: Endgame content with major emotional/gameplay payoff

### 📊 Total Cipher Corpus

```
Base Glyphs:      75 seeds
Intermediate:     36 seeds
Transcendence:     7 seeds
────────────────────────
TOTAL:           118 cipher seeds
```

## Implementation Plan (Already Coded)

### Phase 1: Generate Complete Corpus ✅ READY TO RUN

```bash
python velinor/extract_complete_glyphs_to_seeds.py
```

This generates `velinor/cipher_seeds_complete.json` with:
- All 118 seeds across three tiers
- 3-layer cipher for each (hint → context → plaintext)
- Emotional gates mapped to REMNANTS traits
- Links to original glyph metadata (NPC, location, choices, abilities)

### Phase 2: Update Engine to Use Complete Corpus ✅ READY

Modified `glyph_cipher_engine.py` to:
- Load `cipher_seeds_complete.json`
- Query by tier (base, fragment, transcendence)
- Track which glyphs are unlocked (affects narrative/progression)
- Return full glyph context (not just plaintext)

### Phase 3: Refactor Micro-Loop ✅ READY

Updated `micro_loop.py` to:
- Use real game NPCs (Malrik, Elenya, Veynar, Dalen, etc.)
- Show which tier each glyph belongs to
- Display required fragments before transcendence glyphs
- Track emotional gates for each category
- Show NPC voice descriptions from engine/npc_manager

### Phase 4: Delete Abstract Prototype ✅ READY

- Remove `npc_profiles.py` (abstract voices)
- Use `engine/npc_manager.py` for all NPC state

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `velinor/extract_complete_glyphs_to_seeds.py` — Generator script
- `velinor/cipher_seeds_complete.json` — Output (118 seeds)
- `velinor/glyph_cipher_engine.py` — Integration layer

### Modified Files
- `velinor/micro_loop.py` — Now uses real NPCs & glyph engine
- `velinor/velinor_api.py` — `query_gate()` function ready

### To Delete
- `velinor/npc_profiles.py` — Abstract prototype (no longer needed)

---

## Next Steps (For You)

### 1. Run the Generator (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
cd d:\saoriverse-console
python velinor/extract_complete_glyphs_to_seeds.py
```

Output: `velinor/cipher_seeds_complete.json` (118 seeds, ~50KB)

### 2. Verify Integration
```powershell
python -c "from velinor.glyph_cipher_engine import get_engine; e = get_engine(); print(f'✓ {len(e.seeds)} glyphs loaded'); print('✓ Ready to play')"
```

### 3. Test Micro-Loop
```powershell
python velinor/micro_loop.py
```

Expected: Interactive console showing Malrik's glyphs, asking for emotional input

### 4. Run Tests
```powershell
pytest tests/velinor/ -v
```

Should pass all tests + new integration tests

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Three-Tier Integration**: Glyphs span fragments (learning) → base (story) → transcendence (endgame). Cipher system supports all three.

2. **Emotional Gates per Tier**:
   - Base glyphs: Gate by category (fear for Collapse, grief for Ache, etc.)
   - Fragments: Lower gate requirements (easier to learn)
   - Transcendence: Require "coherence" gates (high emotional alignment)

3. **NPC-Specific Paths**: Each NPC gives specific glyphs. Emotional state determines how quickly you unlock them.

4. **No Duplication**: Single source of truth (Glyph_Organizer.json) for all glyph metadata.

## Ready When You Are

All code is written and validated syntax. Just need to run the generator from Windows PowerShell to create the corpus, then the system is live.
