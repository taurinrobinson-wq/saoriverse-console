## 🎯 Lore Corrections Applied

### Language Substitutions Made

| ❌ Technical | ✅ Folklore |
|---|---|
| "glyph-powered ferry" | "small skiff," "raft" |
| "data filtration zone" | "ancient place where water remembers" |
| "Corelink system" | "old water routes," "merchant's memory" |
| "glyph fragments" | "tokens," "keepsakes," "marks" |
| "emotional OS" | "intuition," "feeling," "resonance" |
| "tech remnants" | "old carvings," "weathered stone" |
| "glyphs embedded in ruins" | "bioluminescent flora," "old marks" |

### NPC Dialogue Standards

✅ **No NPC mentions**:
- Technology or systems
- Glyphs (called "marks," "tokens," "signs")
- Corelink or Velhara civilization directly
- Mechanistic processes

✅ **All NPC dialogue uses**:
- Superstition and folklore ("the swamp remembers")
- Intuition and feeling ("your body knows the answer")
- Emotional resonance ("the weight of memory")
- Vague references to "old things" and "old routes"

## 🧩 Three-Passage Structure

### Passage 1: The False Path
- **Gate**: Observation reveals moss patterns; Empathy senses forgotten presence
- **Outcome**: Success → forward; Failure → loop back
- **Lore**: "The swamp doesn't trust easy passages"

### Passage 2: The Fog Logic Puzzle
- **Gate**: Pure intuition (five emotion-shaped stones, no names given)
- **Solution**: The still/quiet stone (Stillness marker)
- **Mechanics**: Empathy, Observation, or pure trial-and-error can succeed
- **Lore**: "The swamp whispers. Just impressions."

### Passage 3: The Hidden Threshold
- **Gate**: Empathy unlocks "resonance encounter" (memory air)
- **Reward**: Tokens (Drossel's five emotional anchors)
- **Outcome**: Empathy +1, Observation +1, preparation for Drossel confrontation
- **Lore**: "You're holding his secrets now"

## 🎤 Dialogue Voice Consistency

### Kaelen (Primary Guide)
> "This place… it's not what he said it was. Feels like the swamp's playin' tricks."  
> "The tokens. Five of them. He always carried all five... because alone, each one is a fragment. Together, they're a voice."

### Environmental Voice
> "The swamp whispers. Not words. Not quite sounds. Impressions that land in your chest."  
> "The air here is heavy. Not with weight—with presence."

### NPC Recognition
> "I haven't seen one of those marks in years. My mother used to say they were tied to people. That carrying one meant you'd touched something sacred in them."

## 🔄 Integration Points

**Story Flow**:
1. Kaelen Trust (0.6+) → Swamp maze invitation
2. Navigate three passages → Emotional growth + token collection
3. Tokens inform Drossel encounter → Deeper understanding of isolation
4. Final confrontation → Player emotionally prepared

**Mechanical Gates**:
- **Observation**: Reveals patterns, shortcuts, logical clues
- **Empathy**: Senses emotional echoes, unlocks memory encounters
- **Trust**: Determines how much Kaelen guides vs. tests

## 🎨 Design Philosophy Achieved

✨ **Zero Immersion Breaking**: No technological language breaks character

- ✅ **Optional side-quest** framework (unlocks at 0.6+ trust)
- ✅ **Folklore-only language** (marks, tokens, keepsakes, whispers)
- ✅ **Mechanical truth hidden** (engine knows, NPCs don't)
- ✅ **Player experience arc** (disorientation → recognition → integration)
