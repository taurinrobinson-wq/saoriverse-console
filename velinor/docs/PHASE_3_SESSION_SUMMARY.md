# PHASE 3 SESSION SUMMARY

**Session Date**: January 7, 2026  
**Duration**: Single session  
**Outcome**: Phase 3 complete and tested ✅  

---

## What We Accomplished

### Complete Phase 3 Implementation

Designed and built the entire Building Collapse Event system - a complex, interconnected narrative
and mechanical system where:

1. **8-Phase Timeline**: From stable peace (PRE_COLLAPSE) through crisis (ESCALATING_CONFLICT) to
resolution (AFTERMATH_RESOLUTION) 2. **Dynamic Building Status**: Visual indicators of deterioration
tracked across 15+ days 3. **NPC Emotional Arcs**: Malrik/Elenya stress and cooperation tracked
continuously 4. **Player Agency**: Intervention mechanics allowing players to influence outcomes
during aftermath 5. **Three Branching Paths**: Outcome determined by accumulation of player
interventions (not individual choices) 6. **Ending Gating**: Each path unlocks specific endings that
will be implemented in Phase 4

### Code Deliverables

**New Systems**:
- `EventTimeline` class (340 lines): Complete day/phase/aftermath tracking
- `CollapseTriggerScene` class (420 lines): Narration for collapse event
- `ImmediateAftermathScene` class: NPC isolation and intervention responses
- `AftermathPathDivergence` class: Three distinct path narrations

**Integration**:
- 7 new methods in orchestrator.py for Phase 3 functionality
- Seamless Phase 2 → Phase 3 transition via `set_marketplace_conclusion()`
- Full event lifecycle from collapse trigger to path resolution

**Testing**:
- 14 comprehensive integration tests
- 100% test pass rate (14/14) ✅
- Tests validate: timeline progression, building deterioration, NPC stress, player interventions, path determination, orchestrator integration, Phase 2/3 continuity

## Architecture Overview

### System Design

```
EventTimeline (Core)
├─ Tracks 7+ in-game days
├─ 8 distinct phases with auto-transitions
├─ Building structural integrity (100% → 0%)
├─ NPC emotional states (stress, cooperation)
├─ Player intervention accumulation
└─ Aftermath path determination

CollapseTriggerScene (Narration)
├─ Initial rumble
├─ Structural failure sequence
├─ NPC immediate reactions
├─ Post-collapse dialogue

AftermathSystem (Resolution)
├─ Path A: Rebuild Together (65%+ interventions)
├─ Path B: Stalemate (35-65% interventions)
├─ Path C: Complete Separation (<35% interventions)
└─ Ending connections for Phase 4
```

### Timeline Progression

```
Days 1-2:   PRE_COLLAPSE (building 100% stable)
Days 3-5:   SUBTLE_DETERIORATION (cracks visible, stress ↑)
Days 6-10:  ESCALATING_CONFLICT (roof sagging, cooperation ↓)
Days 10-15: FINAL_WARNING (30% stability, Coren warns)
Day 15+:    COLLAPSE_TRIGGER (building destroyed at 0%)
Days 1-3:   IMMEDIATE_AFTERMATH (factions separate, interventions)
Days 4-7:   AFTERMATH_RESOLUTION (path determined)
Day 8+:     POST_COLLAPSE (ending unlocked)
```

### Aftermath Path Determination

| Path | Requirement | Trigger | Outcome | Endings |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Rebuild Together** | 65%+ rebuild potential | 4+ interventions | Factions unite, morale ↑ | 1, 4 |
| **Stalemate** | 35-65% rebuild potential | 1-3 interventions | Functional but diminished | 5, 6 |
| **Complete Separation** | <35% rebuild potential | 0 interventions | Factions fracture, hope ↓ | 2, 3 |

## Key Design Features

### 1. Meaningful Progression

Each game day produces tangible changes:
- Building deteriorates progressively
- NPCs experience emotional escalation
- Player interventions accumulate toward paths
- No "dead" days - everything matters

### 2. Pattern Recognition

System rewards authentic play:
- Interventions accumulate (not overridden by single choices)
- Rebuild potential calculated from total interventions
- Coherence from Phase 2 affects NPC baseline stress
- Multiple valid paths to each ending

### 3. NPC Autonomy

NPCs aren't puppets:
- Malrik/Elenya stress increases independently
- Cooperation decreases unless player intervenes
- Coren attempts mediation (can fail)
- No guarantee that reunion is possible

### 4. Narrative Consequences

Choices cascade:
- High interventions → Rebuild Together → Synthesis endings
- Low interventions → Complete Separation → Collapse endings
- Medium interventions → Stalemate → Ambiguous endings
- Each path has distinct 800+ word narrations

### 5. System Mirroring

Building collapse mirrors character breakdown:
- Malrik's rigidity = structure failing
- Elenya's frustration = system not valuing her
- Coren's exhaustion = mediation breaking down
- Player intervention = human connection holding things together

## Integration Points

### Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3

```
Phase 1: Trait System Foundation
└─ TraitProfiler, CoherenceCalculator, NPCResponseEngine

Phase 2: Orchestrator + Marketplace
├─ Trait system wired to game loop
├─ Marketplace scene with coherence-gated paths
└─ NPC compatibility calculated

Phase 3: Collapse Event
├─ Phase 2 coherence affects NPC cooperation baseline
├─ Phase 2 primary trait affects conflict initial state
├─ Trait profiler continues tracking interventions
├─ Coherence level affects NPC stress responses
└─ Outcome: Path determination → Ending unlock
```

### API for Phase 4

EventTimeline provides complete state:
```python
event_timeline.get_game_state() → {
    "current_day": int,
    "current_phase": str,
    "aftermath_path": str,  # REBUILD_TOGETHER, STALEMATE, COMPLETE_SEPARATION
    "building_stability": int,  # 0-100%
    "malrik_stress": int,  # 0-100
    "elenya_stress": int,  # 0-100
    "collapse_triggered": bool,
    "rebuild_potential": int,
    "player_interventions": int
}
```

Phase 4 will use `aftermath_path` to gate ending options.

## Known Limitations & Design Decisions

### Limitations
1. **Collapse timing**: Fixed at ~day 15 (could be randomized in future) 2. **Intervention
effectiveness**: All interventions +15 (could vary by type) 3. **NPC autonomy**: Limited to
stress/cooperation (could add independent actions)

### Design Decisions
1. **Three paths only**: Simplifies ending design and player understanding 2. **Intervention
accumulation**: Rewards consistent play over single dramatic acts 3. **Fixed phase transitions**:
Creates pacing predictability for players 4. **No "failure" path**: All paths lead to valid,
meaningful endings

---

## What's Ready for Phase 4

✅ EventTimeline tracks all game state needed for endings ✅ Three distinct aftermath paths identified
and gated ✅ Ending unlock conditions determined (path + coherence) ✅ NPC final states recorded
(stress, cooperation, position) ✅ Corelink decision framework (will be major choice in Phase 4) ✅
Reincarnation loop hook available (potential Phase 5)

---

## What Comes Next

### Phase 4: Ending System (Ready to Start)

6 distinct endings, each 1,000+ words: 1. **Synthesis Ending**: Rebuild Together + High Coherence 2.
**Isolation Ending**: Complete Separation + High Awareness 3. **Collapse Ending**: Complete
Separation + Low Coherence 4. **New Vision Ending**: Rebuild Together + High Integration 5.
**Ambiguity Ending**: Stalemate + Mixed Traits 6. **Resignation Ending**: Stalemate + High
Skepticism

Estimated: 5-7 days

## Highlights

### Best Aspects
1. **Organic Progression**: Building deterioration feels natural, not rushed 2. **NPC Depth**:
Malrik/Elenya arcs feel earned, not scripted 3. **Player Agency**: Interventions matter without
railroading player 4. **Narrative Quality**: Collapse sequence reads genuinely and emotionally 5.
**System Integration**: Phase 1/2/3 systems work seamlessly together

### Technical Achievements
1. **Clean Architecture**: Three independent scene classes, EventTimeline core 2. **Modular
Design**: Each phase is independent, can be modified later 3. **Comprehensive Testing**: 14 tests
covering all major paths and mechanics 4. **State Management**: Complete game state serializable and
displayable 5. **Phase Continuity**: Seamless transition from Phase 2 marketplace to Phase 3

## Session Reflection

**What Went Well**:
- Design document was thorough, implementation followed naturally
- Test-driven approach caught issues early
- Phase 2 integration points were already in place
- No blocking issues or design conflicts

**Challenges Overcome**:
- Initial GameSession initialization misunderstanding (quickly fixed)
- CoherenceCalculator method naming (found correct method)
- Phase transition timing (made more flexible)

**Learning Moments**:
- EventTimeline as central source of truth simplifies UI/serialization
- Intervention accumulation better than weighting individual acts
- Three paths create meaningful branching without combinatorial explosion
