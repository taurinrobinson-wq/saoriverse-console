# Velinor: Canonical Six Endings - Consolidated Reference

*Resolving inconsistencies between ending systems and establishing a single authoritative source*

---

## The Ending Architecture

Velinor's ending system operates on **two interdependent axes**:

1. **The Malrik/Elenya Relationship Arc** (Determines "world coherence")
2. **The Final Corelink Choice** (Determines "system resolution")

The combination of these two decisions creates six distinct endings.

---

## The Two Axes Explained

### **Axis 1: Malrik & Elenya's Rebuild State**
This is determined throughout the game by player choices, NPC relationship tracking, and the Collapse Timeline sequence.

**States:**
- **Rebuild Together** (Full synthesis) — Happens when player advocates consistently and intervenes with empathy
- **Partial Rebuild** (In-progress synthesis) — Happens when player shows some advocacy or mixed signals
- **Abandon/Fracture** (No synthesis) — Happens when player doesn't intervene or sides with one faction

### **Axis 2: The Final Corelink Choice**
This happens in the final chamber with Saori and Velinor.

**States:**
- **Restart the System** (Try technological solution again)
- **Abandon the System** (Reject technological solution, build human solution)

### **Additional Axis (Optional Complexity): Saori/Velinor Intervention**
*Note: The VELINOR_SAORI_FINAL_ARC.md describes 6 specific Saori/Velinor branch choices (System Online, Collapse Embraced, Fragments Freed, Cycle Broken, Sacred Withholding, Second Thoughts), but these may represent sub-variations or alternative branching paths rather than the primary six endings. Clarification needed on whether these are separate from or nested within the primary six.*

## The Six Primary Endings (02_SIX_ENDINGS_EXPLICIT_MAP.md - Canonical)

These are created by the **2×3 matrix**: (Restart vs. Abandon) × (Rebuild Together, Partial Rebuild, Abandon/Fracture)

### **Ending 1: The Hopeful Synthesis**
**Conditions:**
- Player chooses: RESTART the Corelink
- World state: Malrik & Elenya REBUILD TOGETHER
- Player path: Synthesis-leaning choices throughout

**Meaning:**
The people of Velhara have learned to hold multiple truths. The system restarts as a *mirror* of what they've already chosen—not a controller, but a reflection of their own coherence.

**Visual/Emotional:** Light returning, merged codex colors (blues + ambers → white), healing connection between Saori and Velinor.

**End Note:** *"The system was never the problem. The system was a mirror. Now that we've learned to hold each other, the mirror can show us what we're capable of."*

**Mechanical Impact:** All factions open dialogue. Future conflicts are synthesized rather than managed.

**Tier:** Hopeful

---

### **Ending 2: The Pyrrhic Restart**
**Conditions:**
- Player chooses: RESTART the Corelink
- World state: Malrik & Elenya ABANDON/FRACTURE
- Player path: Intellectual understanding but emotional distance

**Meaning:**
The player understood the philosophy but couldn't make it happen. The system restarts anyway, hoping technology can solve what people couldn't. It succeeds technically but fails emotionally—history repeats.

**Visual/Emotional:** Corelink glows with eerie, artificial quality. Malrik and Elenya walk away as silhouettes. City lights return but feel hollow.

**End Note:** *"We restarted the machine. The city glows again. But the fault lines remain, waiting for the next crack."*

**Mechanical Impact:** Factions continue old power struggles. System works, but world remains fractured.

**Tier:** Pyrrhic

---

### **Ending 3: The Honest Collapse**
**Conditions:**
- Player chooses: ABANDON the Corelink
- World state: Malrik & Elenya ABANDON/FRACTURE
- Player path: Authentic skepticism of systems

**Meaning:**
The player chooses not to restart the system. Neither do the people choose to rebuild. The city is genuinely broken, but people face it honestly without illusions of technological salvation.

**Visual/Emotional:** Corelink dims and goes dark. City lights go out one by one. But in the marketplace, small fires light up as people gather to rebuild by hand. Malrik's archive is a skeleton. Elenya's mystics scatter.

**End Note:** *"We stopped trying to fix it with machines. Now we have to fix it with our own hands. It will take longer. We might fail. But at least we'll fail honestly."*

**Mechanical Impact:** No centralized system. Future choices are genuinely dangerous. Emergent communities form organically.

**Tier:** Honest

---

### **Ending 4: The Earned Synthesis**
**Conditions:**
- Player chooses: ABANDON the Corelink
- World state: Malrik & Elenya REBUILD TOGETHER
- Player path: Full synthesis + active advocacy

**Meaning:**
The hardest ending. The player refuses the technological shortcut. The people choose to build coherence themselves. It's not finished—it may never be—but it's earned.

**Visual/Emotional:** Corelink fades into silence. From above comes sound of construction. Rebuilt archive is half-Malrik, half-Elenya. Saori and Velinor's connection healing. Marketplace alive with possibility. Coren stands as friend, not mediator.

**End Note:** *"We chose not to let the machine decide anymore. So now we have to be brave enough to decide for ourselves. It's harder. But it's ours."*

**Mechanical Impact:** Emotional OS becomes understanding tool, not control tool. Future is genuinely open-ended.

**Tier:** Earned (highest)

---

### **Ending 5: The Technical Solution (Mid-Rebuild)**
**Conditions:**
- Player chooses: RESTART the Corelink
- World state: Malrik & Elenya in PARTIAL REBUILD (in-progress synthesis)
- Player path: Some but not all synthesis pathways

**Meaning:**
The system and people are in dialogue. System restarts as Malrik and Elenya begin rebuilding. They learn from each other in real time—not perfect, but calibrating together.

**Visual/Emotional:** Corelink restarts with warmer tone. As it powers up, receives signals from the rebuilding archive below—two factions' voices intertwining in data. Softer, more distributed city light.

**End Note:** *"The system and the people are learning together. It's not perfect yet. But it's a beginning."*

**Mechanical Impact:** System works better because people did the work first. Factions in real dialogue. Future conflicts mediated.

**Tier:** Partial

---

### **Ending 6: The Stalemate**
**Conditions:**
- Player chooses: ABANDON the Corelink
- World state: Malrik & Elenya in PARTIAL REBUILD (in-progress synthesis)
- Player path: Detachment from factional dynamics

**Meaning:**
No system. No guarantor. But there is movement—people rebuilding imperfectly, without institutional support. Messy, uncertain, but authentic.

**Visual/Emotional:** Corelink goes dark. City dim, lit by small fires and bioluminescence. Archive work is tentative and uncertain. Coren mediates without institutional power. Saori and Velinor connection healing slowly.

**End Note:** *"We chose not to let the machine decide anymore. Now we're learning to work together without it. It's harder than we thought. But we're trying."*

**Mechanical Impact:** No centralized authority, but no catalyst. Factions rebuild slowly and organically.

**Tier:** Partial

## The Saori/Velinor Sub-Paths (VELINOR_SAORI_FINAL_ARC.md)

Note: These six choices appear to represent variations *within* the final chamber sequence, potentially sub-branching from the primary six endings above. **Clarification needed on whether these replace or nest within the primary six.**

| Sub-Path | Velinor Fate | Saori Fate | Archive Fate |
|----------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **System Online (Trust Path)** | Restored, fused | Relieved, guilty | Unified but constrained |
| **Collapse Embraced (Exposure Path)** | Scattered, conscious | Devastated, exposed | Destroyed, truth revealed |
| **Fragments Freed (Reconciliation)** | Gone, honored | Grieving, at peace | Scattered as remembrance |
| **Cycle Broken (Destruction)** | Scattered, unrepairable | Permanently broken | Lost forever |
| **Sacred Withholding (Ambiguity)** | Partially alive, ambiguous | Uncertain, waiting | Selectively preserved |
| **Second Thoughts (Interrogation)** | Unresolved, questioned | Truth confronted | Dormant, pending |

## How Player Choices Lead to Malrik/Elenya States

### **To Trigger "Rebuild Together"**
- Early choices: Show empathy and understanding with Ravi/Nima
- Collapse sequence: Intervene with compassion when archive building collapses
- Post-collapse: Advocate for synthesis between Malrik and Elenya
- Coren's observation: Player models integration consistently
- Result: **Probability ~60-80%** (if player follows synthesis path actively)

### **To Trigger "Partial Rebuild"**
- Mixed choices: Some empathy, some skepticism throughout
- Collapse sequence: Some intervention, some distance
- Post-collapse: Acknowledge both perspectives without strong advocacy
- Coren's observation: Player is thoughtful but not actively catalyzing
- Result: **Probability ~40-60%** (if player takes middle path)

### **To Trigger "Abandon/Fracture"**
- Skepticism path: Challenge assumptions, maintain distance
- Collapse sequence: Don't intervene or side with one faction
- Post-collapse: Ignore Malrik/Elenya relationship or passively accept separation
- Coren's observation: Player is independent but doesn't model synthesis
- Result: **Probability ~20-40%** (if player takes skeptical/detached path)

## Ending Quality Ranking

**Tier 1: Earned & Genuine**
- **Ending 4** — Full synthesis without system dependency

**Tier 2: Hopeful & Supported**
- **Ending 1** — Synthesis with system as reflection/tool

**Tier 3: Partial & Realistic**
- **Ending 5** — System and people learning together
- **Ending 6** — People working without system's help

**Tier 4: Honest & Unflinching**
- **Ending 3** — Collapse acknowledged, rebuilding happens manually

**Tier 5: Pyrrhic & Hollow**
- **Ending 2** — System works but people didn't learn

---

## Core Philosophy

**"Systems cannot do what people cannot."**

The six endings all illustrate this principle:
- Endings 1 & 4 show what happens when people learn synthesis (system is secondary)
- Endings 2 & 3 show what happens when people don't (system is irrelevant)
- Endings 5 & 6 show the in-between state (system and people co-learning or struggling)

The real ending isn't determined by the Corelink choice. It's determined by whether Malrik and Elenya—and by extension, the community—chose synthesis or fracture.

---

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Track Malrik/Elenya relationship as continuous variable (0.0-1.0)
- [ ] Assign relationship breakpoints: <0.33 = Fracture, 0.33-0.66 = Partial, >0.66 = Rebuild
- [ ] Track player's synthesis path (empathy choices, advocacy interventions)
- [ ] At final chamber, detect player's restart/abandon choice
- [ ] Combine: Malrik/Elenya state + Player choice = one of six endings
- [ ] Display ending-specific cinematics, dialogue, and NPC reactions
- [ ] Optional: Allow Saori/Velinor sub-choices to create narrative variation within chosen ending
- [ ] Track ending achieved for future NG+ or achievement systems

---

## Unresolved Questions for Clarification

1. **Are the Saori/Velinor sub-paths (6 branches from VELINOR_SAORI_FINAL_ARC.md) separate from or nested within the primary six endings?**
   - Option A: They replace the primary six (primary doc is outdated)
   - Option B: They nest within (3 primary paths × 2 Saori choices = 6 variations)
   - Option C: They're parallel branching (player gets two sequential choices)

2. **How much does the specific Saori/Velinor choice weight against the Malrik/Elenya state?**
   - Is Malrik/Elenya the primary determinant, with Saori/Velinor as flavor?
   - Or are both equally determinant?

3. **Can player achieve any ending regardless of Malrik/Elenya state, or are some endings locked?**
   - E.g., can player achieve "Earned Synthesis" if Malrik/Elenya fractured?
   - Or is Saori/Velinor choice what "unlocks" the ending despite Malrik/Elenya?

---

## Recommendation

**For Implementation:** Use the **02_SIX_ENDINGS_EXPLICIT_MAP.md** as the primary system (it's clearer and more structured), and integrate the **VELINOR_SAORI_FINAL_ARC.md** sub-paths as narrative variations/cinematics within each primary ending.

This gives:
- **6 primary endings** (determined by Malrik/Elenya + Corelink choice)
- **6 narrative variants** (determined by Saori/Velinor chamber choice)
- Potential for **up to 12 distinct playthroughs** (if both choices independently affect outcome)
- Clear branching structure for implementation

---

*All six endings are genuine. None is "correct." Each is a philosophical mirror of the player's choices.*
