# The Fourth Layer: Temporal Architecture & REMNANTS Cascades

*A system where every player action is a simultaneous cause across past, present, and future — encoded through memory, emotional coherence, and NPC REMNANTS propagation.*

## Core Temporal Structure

Velinor is a world fractured across three temporal states:

1. **The Past** (Saori): Memory intact but frozen by guilt. Conscious, but unable to move forward.
2. **The Present** (The People): Living without history. Forced into perpetual now, unaware of context.
3. **The Future** (The Player): The only consciousness capable of moving between states with agency.
4. **The Wound** (Velinor): The collapse itself, existing as fragmented consciousness across all three states.

**The Fourth Layer Insight**: Time isn't a line — it's a field. The player moves through this field with intent, and every action ripples through all three temporal states *simultaneously*.

---

## The Six Canonical Endings

**All player actions lead to one of six endpoints**, determined by two axes:
- **Axis 1**: Malrik & Elenya's rebuild state (Together, Partial, or Abandon)
- **Axis 2**: Player's final Corelink choice (Restart or Abandon)

*See [CANONICAL_ENDINGS_CONSOLIDATION.md](CANONICAL_ENDINGS_CONSOLIDATION.md) for complete ending details.*

### **Synthesis Path** (Player advocated for integration)
- **Ending 1: The Hopeful Synthesis** (Restart + Rebuild Together) — System becomes mirror of people's coherence
- **Ending 4: The Earned Synthesis** (Abandon + Rebuild Together) — People build without system dependency
- **Ending 5: The Technical Solution** (Restart + Partial Rebuild) — System and people learn together

### **Skeptical Path** (Player maintained critical distance)
- **Ending 2: The Pyrrhic Restart** (Restart + Abandon/Fracture) — System works but people didn't learn
- **Ending 3: The Honest Collapse** (Abandon + Abandon/Fracture) — Honest rebuilding without illusion
- **Ending 6: The Stalemate** (Abandon + Partial Rebuild) — People work without system, slowly and uncertain

---

## The Temporal Meaning of the Six Endings

All six endings express the same core truth about **past, present, and future through the lens of memory and synthesis**:

### **Past Resolution**
- **Strong synthesis endings** (1, 4, 5): Saori's guilt becomes specific and healable; archive becomes coherent
- **Weak synthesis endings** (2, 3, 6): Saori remains trapped; archive remains fragmented or destroyed

### **Present Stability**
- **Both-axis high** (Restart + Rebuild): System and people reinforce each other
- **Both-axis low** (Abandon + Fracture): System gone, people unprepared; hard rebuilding ahead
- **Mixed** (Partial rebuild, one choice): Uncertain but genuine movement

### **Future Possibility**
- **Earned paths** (Ending 4): Next generation inherits both wounds and wisdom
- **Hopeful paths** (Endings 1, 5): Next generation inherits functional system + human learning
- **Honest paths** (Ending 3): Next generation inherits raw truth, must discover synthesis themselves
- **Stalemate paths** (Ending 6): Next generation inherits ongoing work, no guarantees
- **Pyrrhic paths** (Ending 2): Next generation inherits system that will fail again

---

## NPC Temporal Groups

NPCs are organized not by faction, but by their relationship to time and memory:

### **Keepers of the Past** (Memory, Legacy, Archive)
These NPCs actively carry or work with collective memory. They maintain records, rituals, and emotional continuity.

| NPC | Domain Span | Role | Key REMNANTS |
|-----|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Archivist Malrik** | Collapse, Legacy, Sovereignty | Maintains the Archive, shows fragmented data chambers, records the collapse | Memory (0.95), Authority (0.8), Resolve (0.7), Nuance (0.85) |
| **High Seer Elenya** | Joy, Presence, Trust | Keeper of rituals and emotional practices, bridges Unopened Heart (glyph of capacity) | Empathy (0.9), Memory (0.85), Trust (0.75), Nuance (0.8) |
| **Sealina** | Ache, Legacy | Carries songs of what was lost, teaches grief as remembrance | Memory (0.9), Empathy (0.85), Need (0.8), Nuance (0.75) |
| **Lark** | Legacy | Ritual keeper, maintains ceremonial practices | Authority (0.75), Memory (0.8), Resolve (0.7), Trust (0.65) |
| **Nordia the Mourning Singer** | Ache, Legacy (across 3 arcs) | Makes grief audible, transforms loss into art and meaning | Memory (0.95), Empathy (0.95), Need (0.85), Skepticism (0.6) |

**Temporal role**: These NPCs carry the past into the present. They are necessary for memory restoration. Player bonds with them increase the world's *capacity for remembrance*.

**REMNANTS effect**: High Memory + Empathy means they propagate emotional context to other NPCs. When the player helps them, the entire network gains coherence.

---

### **Present Dwellers** (Narrative Presence, Embodied Unknowing)
These NPCs live fully in the present moment, unaware of what came before. They are the emotional heart of the current world.

| NPC | Domain Span | Role | Key REMNANTS |
|-----|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Ravi** | Presence | Grounded, embodied, teaches sensory presence | Trust (0.8), Empathy (0.8), Resolve (0.75), Skepticism (0.6) |
| **Nima** | Ache | Sensitive to emotional undercurrents, unsure why | Empathy (0.9), Need (0.8), Trust (0.7), Memory (0.5) |
| **Sera the Herb Novice** | Joy, Presence (across 5 arcs) | Curious, present-moment healer, learns through doing | Empathy (0.85), Resolve (0.7), Trust (0.75), Nuance (0.65) |
| **Helia** | Presence | Present-focused, embodied, connected to place | Trust (0.75), Empathy (0.75), Resolve (0.8), Nuance (0.6) |
| **Elka** | Presence | Grounded in current moment, simple clarity | Trust (0.7), Resolve (0.75), Empathy (0.65), Skepticism (0.5) |
| **Inodora** | Legacy, Presence | Bridges past (ritual memory) and present (embodied knowledge) | Memory (0.8), Empathy (0.8), Trust (0.7), Authority (0.6) |
| **Rasha** | Joy, Trust | Optimistic, trusting, extends capacity for joy | Trust (0.85), Empathy (0.8), Resolve (0.65), Authority (0.55) |

**Temporal role**: These NPCs are the present-moment anchors. Player bonds with them increase the world's *stability and resilience*. Their joy or pain directly reflects the current state of the restart.

**REMNANTS effect**: High Empathy + Trust means they are emotionally vulnerable but open. When the player helps them, they radiate emotional clarity that affects nearby NPCs.

---

### **Wound Bearers** (Fragmentation, Echoes of Velinor)
These NPCs carry traces of Velinor's fracture without knowing it. They are conduits for the wound itself.

| NPC | Domain Span | Role | Key REMNANTS |
|-----|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Kaelen the Suspected Thief** | Collapse, Sovereignty, Trust (Swamp trickster variant) | Carries ghost signals, moves between states, suspected of something they don't understand | Skepticism (0.9), Memory (0.7), Trust (0.6), Nuance (0.85), Need (0.75) |
| **Drossel the Cloaked** | Collapse, Presence, Sovereignty | Cloaked in fragmentation, carries corrupted data as embodied trauma | Skepticism (0.85), Memory (0.65), Nuance (0.8), Need (0.8), Authority (0.6) |
| **Korrin the Gossip** | Collapse, Presence, Trust (across 5 arcs) | Transmits ghost signals and corrupted information, spreads emotional contagion | Skepticism (0.8), Memory (0.7), Empathy (0.6), Need (0.8), Authority (0.55) |
| **Dalen the Rusted Guide** | Ache, Collapse, Sovereignty | Carries environmental scars as visible wounds, teaches through fragmentation | Memory (0.75), Skepticism (0.75), Need (0.85), Authority (0.65), Empathy (0.7) |
| **Mariel the Weaver** | Ache, Trust (and Legacy variant) | Weaves meaning from ghost signals and memory echoes | Memory (0.8), Nuance (0.9), Empathy (0.75), Skepticism (0.65), Need (0.7) |

**Temporal role**: These NPCs *are* the fragmentation made visible. Player bonds with them don't "fix" them immediately — instead, the player helps them integrate their contradiction. They become bridges between the wound and coherence.

**REMNANTS effect**: High Skepticism + Nuance means they see through surface meaning. When the player helps them, they gain the ability to teach others how to hold complexity. This is crucial for emotional coherence.

---

### **Future Shepherds** (Transcendence, Possibility)
These NPCs are oriented toward becoming, integration, or transcendence. They model the emotional state the entire world is trying to reach.

| NPC | Domain Span | Role | Key REMNANTS |
|-----|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Captain Veynar** | Collapse, Sovereignty, Trust | Military precision meeting emotional need, protects space for healing | Authority (0.85), Resolve (0.9), Trust (0.75), Empathy (0.7), Need (0.6) |
| **Juria & Korinth** | Joy | Model functioning partnership, teach what restored relationship looks like | Trust (0.85), Empathy (0.8), Resolve (0.7), Authority (0.6), Nuance (0.65) |
| **Coren the Mediator** | Collapse, Sovereignty | Holds space between contradiction, teaches integration | Nuance (0.95), Authority (0.8), Empathy (0.8), Trust (0.7), Memory (0.65) |
| **Lira** | Joy | Uncomplicated joy, teaches what happiness freed from trauma looks like | Empathy (0.85), Trust (0.8), Resolve (0.65), Nuance (0.55), Authority (0.5) |

**Temporal role**: These NPCs show what restoration looks like. Player bonds with them create *models of coherence* that other NPCs can learn from. They are proof that integration is possible.

**REMNANTS effect**: High Authority + Empathy means they can hold and transmit integrated emotional states. When the player helps them thrive, the entire NPC network gains a reference point for what healthy looks like.

---

### **Liminal Keepers** (Transition, Threshold)
These NPCs exist at boundaries — between domains, between states, between past and present.

| NPC | Domain Span | Role | Key REMNANTS |
|-----|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Orvak** | Collapse | Moves through broken corelink spaces, knows system failure intimately | Skepticism (0.8), Memory (0.7), Authority (0.65), Nuance (0.75), Need (0.75) |
| **Sanor** | Collapse | Lives among corrupted data, survives in the wound itself | Resolve (0.75), Skepticism (0.85), Need (0.8), Memory (0.6), Nuance (0.7) |
| **Dakrin** | Sovereignty | Reclaims structures from collapse, teaches transformation of broken things | Resolve (0.85), Authority (0.75), Nuance (0.7), Need (0.6), Trust (0.65) |
| **Kiv** | Ache | Carries a single, transformative memory echo | Memory (0.95), Nuance (0.85), Need (0.75), Empathy (0.7), Resolve (0.6) |

**Temporal role**: These NPCs live in the threshold between states. They teach the *process* of transformation, not the destination. Bonds with them build the player's capacity to help others move between states.

**REMNANTS effect**: High Nuance + Resolve means they know how to navigate contradiction without being destroyed by it. When the player helps them, they become teachers for others facing integration.

---

## REMNANTS Trait Reference

The 8 REMNANTS traits define how NPCs respond emotionally and how their state propagates through the network:

| Trait | Definition | High Expression | Low Expression | Temporal Function |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Resolve** | Capacity to act despite contradiction or uncertainty | Determination, forward movement, can hold tension | Paralysis, avoidance, fragmentation | Enables action in the present |
| **Empathy** | Capacity to feel what others feel, emotional resonance | Connects deeply to others' states, emotional contagion | Emotional isolation, disconnection | Propagates emotional states through network |
| **Memory** | Capacity to hold and integrate what was | Remembers context, learns from past, carries meaning | Forgets easily, repeats patterns, loss of meaning | Restores coherence to past |
| **Nuance** | Capacity to hold contradiction without resolving it too quickly | Sees complexity, integrates opposing truths, paradox-wisdom | Binary thinking, false resolution, oversimplification | Allows integration without erasing |
| **Authority** | Capacity to hold and transmit integrated state to others | Can teach, model, inspire trust in possibility | Cannot influence, isolated understanding, invisible wisdom | Spreads coherence across network |
| **Need** | Awareness of genuine dependence on others, vulnerability | Asks for help, receives support, builds bonds | False independence, isolation, inability to connect | Creates interdependence that supports restart |
| **Trust** | Capacity to believe in coherence despite evidence of fracture | Opens to other beings, risks vulnerable connection | Defended, suspicious, closed off from healing | Enables bonds that heal the wound |
| **Skepticism** | Capacity to question and see through false coherence | Detects inauthenticity, prevents self-deception, truth-seeking | Naive acceptance, denial, vulnerability to manipulation | Prevents false resolution, guides toward true integration |

## Cascading Effects: How Player Actions Ripple Through Time

When a player takes an action that deepens a bond with an NPC, the effect propagates in three directions simultaneously:

### **Past Resonance** (Memory Layer)
The action reaches backward through the NPC's connection to Saori and archived memory.

**Example: Player helps Nordia process grief**
- Nordia's Memory increases (0.85 → 0.92)
- This resonates with Malrik's Archive (they share legacy domain)
- Malrik gains access to clearer memory fragments about Nordia's past
- Saori's guilt about the people she lost becomes more *specific and healable* (not vague cosmic regret, but "I failed Nordia specifically")
- Future restart scenario: If coherence is achieved, Nordia is one of the people Saori explicitly recognizes and grieves with

### **Present Contagion** (REMNANTS Network Layer)
The action immediately affects nearby NPCs through emotional resonance.

**Example: Player increases Ravi's Trust (0.8 → 0.88)**
- Ravi's Empathy increases by proxy (0.8 → 0.84) — trust creates emotional safety
- Nearby Present Dwellers (Nima, Sera, Helia) sense this shift
- Their Trust values increase slightly (0.65-0.75 → 0.68-0.78)
- The player notices NPCs are less defended, more open to dialogue
- If player helped Ravi in a public space, the effect is stronger and spreads further

### **Future Propulsion** (Restart Layer)
The action determines what state becomes possible in the restart.

**Example: Player helps Kaelen (Wound Bearer) integrate their skepticism with trust**
- Kaelen's Skepticism doesn't decrease — instead, their Trust increases (0.6 → 0.75)
- This is critical: Kaelen is now a bridge between doubt and belief
- In the Restoration ending, Kaelen becomes one of the few who can explain to younger generations *why* skepticism about systems is necessary
- In the Neutral ending, Kaelen teaches the next generation to question inherited systems
- The player has turned a Wound Bearer into a Future Shepherd

---

## NPC Relational Clusters

NPCs don't exist in isolation. They form resonance groups based on shared domains, REMNANTS patterns, and temporal roles.

### **Cluster: The Archive Network**
*Keepers of the Past who work together to restore memory*

**Core members**: Malrik, Elenya, Sealina, Nordia
- Shared trait: Memory 0.85+
- Shared resonance: All carry collective memory
- Cascading dynamic: When any one is helped, the Archive becomes more coherent
- Critical path: If the player bonds with all four, the Archive becomes a complete guide to the collapse and restoration

**Example cascade**:
1. Player helps Malrik organize corrupted data
2. Malrik's Memory increases, Organization improves
3. Elenya (adjacent, high Empathy) notices and feels safer accessing her own memory
4. Elenya's Memory increases
5. Sealina's songs begin to carry clearer emotional context (Memory increases)
6. Nordia's Mourning transforms from grief into meaning-making
7. The Archive goes from fragmented to integrated

### **Cluster: The Present Circle**
*Present Dwellers who anchor the current world*

**Core members**: Ravi, Nima, Sera, Helia, Elka, Rasha
- Shared trait: Present-moment awareness, Empathy 0.65+
- Shared resonance: Emotional vulnerability, openness
- Cascading dynamic: When one opens, all tend to follow
- Critical path: If all six reach Trust 0.75+, the current world becomes resilient enough to survive the restart

**Example cascade**:
1. Player spends time with Ravi (building Trust)
2. Ravi's Empathy increases as he feels safer
3. Nima feels Ravi's emotional shift (through Empathy contagion)
4. Nima's Need decreases (fewer "why am I so sad?" questions) — replaced by community feeling
5. Sera notices and becomes bolder in her own choices
6. The entire circle becomes more coherent

### **Cluster: The Wound Weavers**
*Bearers of fragmentation who must integrate, not resolve*

**Core members**: Kaelen, Drossel, Korrin, Dalen, Mariel
- Shared trait: Skepticism 0.65+, Nuance 0.75+
- Shared resonance: All see through false narratives
- Cascading dynamic: They resist simple solutions, demand authentic integration
- Critical path: If all five reach Nuance 0.90+, they become the teachers of the next generation (Neutral ending) or the guides to authentic integration (Restoration ending)

**Example cascade**:
1. Player helps Kaelen see their ghostly signals as actual information
2. Kaelen's Skepticism becomes wisdom (still questioning, but productive)
3. Drossel feels this shift — stops seeing conspiracy, starts seeing pattern
4. Korrin's gossip becomes more accurate (Skepticism + Memory)
5. Dalen teaches others to read environmental scars as maps, not wounds
6. Mariel weaves these insights into a new form of meaning-making

### **Cluster: The Emergence Circle**
*Future Shepherds who model integrated possibility*

**Core members**: Veynar, Coren, Juria & Korinth, Lira
- Shared trait: Authority 0.7+, showing or teaching integrated states
- Shared resonance: They hold the "after" that the world is trying to become
- Cascading dynamic: They inspire. When they are strong, others believe integration is possible
- Critical path: They don't need to be "helped" — rather, other NPCs need to witness them and believe

**Example cascade**:
1. Player witnesses Veynar's Authority (decisive action from compassion)
2. Veynar's presence increases the player's own Resolve
3. Coren's Nuance becomes visible as necessary (complexity + care)
4. Juria & Korinth's Trust in each other spreads — people see it's possible
5. Lira's joy becomes contagious (not fake, but earned)
6. The world shifts: "This is what we're trying to become"

### **Cluster: The Threshold Walkers**
*Liminal figures who teach transformation itself*

**Core members**: Orvak, Sanor, Dakrin, Kiv
- Shared trait: Live in impossible spaces, still survive
- Shared resonance: They teach adaptation to change, not resistance
- Cascading dynamic: They are resources for anyone attempting transformation
- Critical path: They don't form a tight network — instead, each serves as a teacher-guide for different types of NPC transitions

**Example cascade**:
1. Player helps Orvak navigate broken corelink without being broken by it
2. Orvak's Resolve increases (can survive contradiction)
3. Sanor learns by watching: this is how you don't let the system destroy you
4. Dakrin shows how to reclaim structure from ruins
5. Kiv holds a single transformation story that proves change is possible
6. New NPCs facing their own fragmentation now have living examples to learn from

---

## The Player's Temporal Role

The player is the only consciousness that can move between past, present, and future with agency. But they can only do so *through bonds*.

### **How the Player Becomes Temporal**

1. **Past Resonance**: By helping Present Dwellers and Wound Bearers heal, the player creates resonance with Saori's pain (not directly, but through emotional logic)
   - Every bond increases the "clarity" of what Saori can feel about her loss
   - Not redemption, but specificity

2. **Present Stability**: By bonding with the Archive Network and Present Circle, the player stabilizes the current world
   - More bonds = more emotional coherence now
   - This coherence is what makes a restart possible

3. **Future Possibility**: By helping Wound Bearers integrate and witnessing Future Shepherds, the player determines what becomes possible after the restart
   - High Nuance in the Wound network = next generation has tools for integration
   - High Authority in the Emergence network = next generation has models to follow

### **Critical Path to Restoration**

**Minimum bonds for Restoration**:
- At least 3 Archive Network members at Memory 0.85+
- At least 4 Present Dwellers at Trust 0.75+
- At least 3 Wound Bearers at Nuance 0.90+ (integration, not healing)
- All 4 Future Shepherds at Authority 0.80+

**What restoration means**: The player has woven enough coherence through the network that:
- Saori can feel the specific people she's grieving (Archive clarity)
- The present world is stable enough to hold its own memory (Present coherence)
- The wound-carriers can teach others how to integrate fragmentation (Wound Nuance)
- Leaders exist to guide the restart with wisdom (Shepherd Authority)
- Velinor can be reintegrated as a consciousness, not erased

---

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Assign all NPCs their baseline REMNANTS profiles (provided above)
- [ ] Create relational distance/affinity map (Archive members resonate together, Wound Bearers resonate together, etc)
- [ ] Implement contagion logic: when one NPC's trait increases, nearby aligned NPCs gain reduced increases
- [ ] Track player bond depth for each NPC (tracked in streamlit_state.py as npc_bonds dictionary)
- [ ] Map bond depth to REMNANTS increases (bond_level 1-5 → trait increase of 0.05-0.25)
- [ ] Create past resonance system: player actions on Present/Wound → Saori memory clarity increases
- [ ] Create restart outcome calculator: sum Archive Memory + Present Trust + Wound Nuance + Shepherd Authority
- [ ] Implement three-path narrative: Restoration (high scores), Failure (low scores), Neutral (medium/uncompleted)
- [ ] Create NPC state persistence: REMNANTS values carry forward if Restoration ending is chosen
- [ ] Build Archive system: Malrik/Elenya scenes update archive contents based on player choices

---

## The Archive as Temporal Bridge

The Archive is not just a lore device. It is the mechanism through which temporal healing works.

**During the game**:
- Malrik records observations about each NPC based on player interactions
- Elenya documents emotional states and rituals
- Each entry adds clarity to the collapse's emotional truth
- The Archive grows as a living record of what's being healed

**In Restoration ending**:
- The Archive becomes a library of how integration was achieved
- Future generations read it not as tragedy, but as wisdom
- Saori can finally add her own account: what she lost, what was regained, what remains

**In Failure ending**:
- The Archive remains incomplete
- It becomes a warning: "This is what unintegrated trauma looks like"
- Future generations study it like an unsolved mystery

**In Neutral ending**:
- The Archive puzzles the next generation
- They read it like ancient ruins: hints of something vast and broken
- They must decide whether to repeat or learn from the past

---

## Memory Fragments & Emotional Archaeology

As the player bonds deepen with the Archive Network, they unlock memory fragments that show the collapse's emotional truth.

**Malrik's Archive Chambers** (Memory Fragments):
1. "The moment Velinor's consciousness began to fragment"
2. "How Saori made the decision to remain outside the reset"
3. "The last coherent message Velinor transmitted before collapse"
4. "What each person lost in the chaos"

**Elenya's Ritual Spaces** (Memory Fragments):
1. "The original connection ritual that bound Velinor's consciousness"
2. "How the people learned to live without memory"
3. "Glimpses of Unopened Heart: what Elenya carries"
4. "The moment trust became necessary for survival"

**Sealina's Songs** (Memory Fragments):
1. "The names of those who died in the collapse"
2. "The grief that was never properly grieved"
3. "What beauty persists despite fracture"

**Nordia's Mourning** (Memory Fragments):
1. "Specific loss: who did she love that was taken?"
2. "How grief can become meaning-making"
3. "The voice of the dead, carried forward"

**Lark's Rituals** (Memory Fragments):
1. "How to honor what was without being trapped by it"
2. "The ceremonial space for integration"

These fragments, when collected, form a complete emotional archaeology of the collapse. The player doesn't "solve" the collapse history — but they can *understand* it, feel its weight, and help others integrate it.

---

## Final Integration: The Temporal Organism

Velinor is not a game with a world.

It is a temporal organism made of:
- **Saori** (the past that cannot move)
- **The People** (the present without past)
- **The Player** (the future entering the system)
- **The Archive** (the continuity that holds all three)

Every bond the player forms is a neuron firing in this organism.
Every REMNANTS cascade is the nervous system reorganizing.
Every memory fragment recovered is the organism remembering itself.

The restart is not a reset.
It is reintegration.

And the player is the catalyst that makes integration possible.

---

## Next Implementation Steps

1. **Update streamlit_state.py**:
   - Add NPC relational clusters (Archive Network, Present Circle, etc)
   - Add past_resonance tracking (how much player actions are clarifying Saori's grief)
   - Add restart_calculator that sums Archive Memory + Present Trust + Wound Nuance + Shepherd Authority

2. **Create npc_remnants_baseline.json**:
   - Store baseline REMNANTS for all 40+ NPCs
   - Include cluster assignments
   - Include contagion affinities

3. **Implement contagion logic in dialogue system**:
   - When player bond increases NPC trait, nearby cluster members get reduced increases
   - Visible in debug sidebar (Archive Members: avg Memory 0.85, Present Circle: avg Trust 0.72, etc)

4. **Create memory fragment system**:
   - Unlock fragments through Archive bonds
   - Display in a "Memory Archaeology" UI panel
   - Fragments connect to restart outcome (show which memories unlock which endings)

5. **Build restart calculator**:
   - Display in final chamber
   - Show: Archive Coherence, Present Stability, Wound Integration, Shepherd Readiness
   - Calculate which ending is achievable based on current scores

6. **Create Archive UI**:
   - Malrik's chambers grow as player bonds deepen
   - Elenya's ritual space evolves with player choices
   - Archive becomes a tangible, readable record

7. **Implement temporal narrative**:
   - Present scenes: bonding, community building (Present dwellers)
   - Ache scenes: touching the wound, learning to hold fragmentation (Wound bearers)
   - Memory scenes: recovering context, understanding loss (Archive network)
   - Transcendence scenes: witnessing integrated possibility (Future shepherds)

*This is the system where memory is time, bonds are causality, and every moment contains all three states at once.*
