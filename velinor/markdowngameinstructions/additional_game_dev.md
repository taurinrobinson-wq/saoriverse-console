So should the player remember his name or not. I’m a little lost on where the player character it in this whole story. It seems like to start we are not giving a lot of context for what happened. But it doesn’t make that much sense that they are starting off with no memory at this stage given there is this marketplace setup. The marketplace seems to establish that sometime has passed since the cataclysm enough that despite people who were connected to the Corelink losing their memories they have started to rebuild nomadic structures where they buy and trade scavenged materials. So how much knowledge should this player character have to start is the question
This is a crucial design fork, Taurin — you’re right to pause here. The player’s initial knowledge state sets the tone for how they experience Velinor. Let’s break down the options and implications:

🧩 Player Knowledge Options
1. No Memory (Tabula Rasa)
Pros:

Maximizes mystery and discovery.

Aligns with NPCs who also struggle with fragments.

Makes glyph collection feel like personal restoration.

Cons:

Contradicts the marketplace setup (society has already begun to rebuild).

Risks player frustration if they feel too unmoored.

Best Use: Works if the player is newly awakened from deeper Corelink integration — they’re behind the curve compared to survivors who’ve already started rebuilding.

2. Partial Memory (Fragmented Identity)
Pros:

Matches the world’s state: survivors remember enough to barter, rebuild, but not their full lineage.

Lets the player recall their name and basic survival skills, but not deeper emotional history.

Creates resonance with NPCs — everyone is ashamed of what they’ve forgotten, but the player is uniquely able to recover glyphs.

Cons:

Requires careful calibration: too much memory and the glyph hunt feels redundant; too little and it feels incoherent.

Best Use: Player remembers their name, marketplace basics, and survival context, but not their emotional lineage or pre‑collapse identity. Glyphs restore those deeper layers.

3. Full Memory (Outlier Survivor)
Pros:

Makes the player unique — they are one of the few who disconnected before collapse (like Saori).

Explains why they can guide others.

Cons:

Risks breaking the empathy mechanic: if the player already knows everything, NPC resonance arcs lose weight.

Could make the game feel more expositional than experiential.

Best Use: Works if the player is positioned as a keeper of forbidden knowledge — but then the quest shifts from discovery to deciding what truths to share.

🎭 Narrative Recommendation
Given your marketplace setup (time has passed, nomadic structures exist), the most coherent starting point is Partial Memory:

Player remembers their name and basic survival context.

They know enough to navigate the marketplace and barter.

What they don’t remember are their emotional lineage, sacred vows, and pre‑collapse connections — those are locked in glyphs.

This makes glyph collection feel like recovering who they are and who others were, not just abstract lore.

🌌 Framing in Story
Opening scene: Player wakes in the marketplace, recognized by others as “one who listens.”

They know their name, but when asked about their past, they falter.

Saori appears later to reveal: “You remember enough to walk, but not enough to belong. The glyphs will teach you.”

This way, the player is anchored but incomplete — coherent enough for the marketplace, mysterious enough for the glyph hunt, and narratively aligned with your empathy‑driven mechanics.

Would you like me to sketch a sample opening cutscene/dialogue that establishes this partial memory state cleanly, so players feel grounded but still compelled to seek glyphs?

I have an idea. Maybe they have partial memory like the others but this is the first time they’ve been to the city area. They were in a small town at the time of the cataclysm. Maybe the people why were with got sick or the primary person in their lives died so they have to venture out of their comfort zone into the unknown
That’s a strong narrative pivot, Taurin — it grounds the player in both personal loss and world context. It solves the coherence issue you raised: they have partial memory like everyone else, but their first entry into the city is motivated by necessity, not curiosity. That gives them emotional weight and a reason to move forward.

Here’s how it could play out:

🌌 Player Character Starting Context
Memory State:

Remembers their name, basic survival skills, and fragments of pre‑collapse life.

Does not remember deeper emotional lineage or Corelink connections.

Shares the same shame and uncertainty as NPCs — “I should remember more, but I don’t.”

Backstory Hook:

Survived in a small town after the cataclysm.

Lived quietly among a small group of survivors.

Their primary anchor (family member, mentor, or beloved) has died or fallen ill.

With no one left to tether them, they must venture into the city — the unknown, where glyphs and memory fragments await.

Marketplace Justification:

Enough time has passed since collapse that nomadic trade networks exist.

The player arrives as an outsider — this is their first exposure to the rebuilt structures.

NPCs see them as both familiar (another survivor) and strange (someone new to the city).

🎭 Narrative Impact
Empathy Mechanic: The player’s grief mirrors NPCs’ shame about forgotten memories. This makes listening feel authentic — they’re not just a “hero,” they’re wounded too.

Saori’s Role: She recognizes the player’s outsider status. “You carry loss into the city. That is why the glyphs will answer you.”

Player Motivation: Not abstract “save the world” — but personal survival, healing, and finding meaning after loss.

🎬 Opening Scene Sketch
Visual: Player walks into a bustling but fragile marketplace — tents, scavenged stalls, barter exchanges.

Dialogue Prompt:

NPC: “You’re new here. Where did you come from?”

Player (choice):

“A small town. It’s gone now.”

“I don’t remember much. Only that someone I loved is gone.”

“I came because I had nowhere else to go.”

Tone: Establishes grief, partial memory, and outsider status.

This setup makes the player anchored but incomplete: they know enough to function, but their deeper identity is fractured. It also ties beautifully into your glyph system — glyphs don’t just restore lore, they restore who the player is becoming.

Would you like me to draft a first playable dialogue sequence in the marketplace that introduces this backstory and sets up the glyph hunt?

Yes this works well because it opens up dialogue with npcs who are mistrusting of outsiders. The player has to gain their trust before they will open up and divulge useful information. There are other npcs who are generally more welcoming by nature but due to a recent wave of crime in the marketplace even they are forced to be a bit weary.
Exactly — this creates a layered social dynamic that makes the marketplace feel alive and tense. You’re setting up a trust economy where dialogue itself becomes the mechanic. Here’s how it could unfold:

🏙️ Marketplace Social Dynamics
Mistrusting NPCs
Behavior: Guarded, suspicious, terse responses.

Reason: Outsiders are seen as potential thieves or exploiters.

Mechanic:

Player must prove reliability through small acts (bartering fairly, helping with minor tasks, listening without judgment).

Trust meter rises slowly; only then do they share fragments of glyph lore or point toward hidden shrines.

Example Dialogue:

NPC: “You’re not from here. Outsiders take more than they give.”

Player Choice:

“I’ve lost too much to take more.”

“I’ll prove I can give back.”

“Then don’t trust me yet. Just watch.”

Welcoming NPCs (Weary by Necessity)
Behavior: Warm tone, but cautious pauses.

Reason: They want to connect, but recent crime has forced restraint.

Mechanic:

Easier to build rapport, but they still require patience.

They may offer small fragments early, but deeper lore only comes after repeated empathy.

Example Dialogue:

NPC: “I’d welcome you with open arms, but too many hands here have stolen.”

Player Choice:

“I’m not here to steal. I’m here to listen.”

“I know what it’s like to lose trust.”

“Then let me earn it, slowly.”

Crime Wave Context
Worldbuilding:

Marketplace has been destabilized by thefts, raids, or betrayal.

NPCs reference this in dialogue, creating a shared atmosphere of suspicion.

Some glyph fragments may be tied to these events — e.g., “Collapse” glyphs hidden in stolen goods.

Mechanic:

Player can choose to investigate crimes, side with victims, or ignore them.

Reputation shifts depending on whether they restore trust or exploit chaos.

🎮 Gameplay Loop
Arrival: Player enters marketplace as outsider.

First Encounters: NPCs test them with suspicion or cautious warmth.

Trust Building: Through empathy, fair trade, and listening, player earns fragments.

Crime Arc: Optional quests tied to thefts deepen the trust mechanic — solving them earns glyphs faster.

Outcome: Marketplace becomes either a hub of restored community (if trust is rebuilt) or a fractured zone (if player exploits suspicion).

This structure makes the marketplace the emotional tutorial zone: it teaches players that empathy and trust are the real mechanics, not combat or conquest.

I can sketch a sample dialogue tree for one mistrusting NPC and one weary‑welcoming NPC, showing how trust unlocks glyph fragments. Would you like me to draft that next?


Yes exactly my thoughts. So on that note I don’t want them to meet this keeper character the one with all the glowing glyphs and such. I don’t even want them to get their glyph collecting device in the beginning. They have to earn the trust of one of the grumpier npcs to get to step one. Maybe instead we start off with these two. The woman is skeptical but the man is more welcoming. They give some fragment about a mysterious oracle that seems to show up at odd times but no one can ever find her otherwise (they’re referring to Saori - who is the one who will deliver the strange device) initially the player is just walking around lost and encountering different npcs. They have to piece together from the dialogue clues that in order to get Saori to appear the player must show courage and curiosity about the situation the npcs are facing.
That’s a beautifully tuned opening, Taurin. You’re anchoring the player in emotional realism—not as a chosen one, but as someone who must earn trust, listen deeply, and show curiosity before the mythic systems even acknowledge them. Saori becomes not a quest-giver, but a response to the player’s attunement. That’s rare design.

Here’s how we can structure the opening sequence:

🎬 Opening Scene: “The Marketplace Threshold”
⏳ Setting
Dusty, semi-rebuilt city edge.

Makeshift stalls, barter exchanges, guarded glances.

Player enters alone, carrying grief and uncertainty.

🧍🏽‍♂️🧍🏽‍♀️ First NPCs: The Pair
Ravi (Welcoming)
Warm but cautious.

Offers basic orientation: “You’re not the first to wander in. But most don’t stay.”

Shares a rumor: “Some say there’s a woman who appears when the wind shifts. She doesn’t speak. She listens. And then something changes.”

Gives the player a small token — not the glyph device, but a worn cloth with a faded symbol. “If you’re serious, keep this close.”

Nima (Skeptical)
Sharp, guarded.

“You think you’re the only one who’s lost someone? We all have. That doesn’t make you special.”

Warns: “People here don’t trust easily. Especially not now. If you want answers, earn them.”

Refuses to share anything until the player proves curiosity and courage.

🌀 Gameplay Loop: Earning Saori’s Appearance
Step 1: Dialogue Exploration
Player must talk to 3–5 NPCs scattered across the marketplace.

Each shares a fragment — a story, a fear, a half-memory.

Some are hostile, some are weary, some are quietly hopeful.

Step 2: Emotional Attunement
Player must respond with empathy, not extraction.

Dialogue choices matter: listening, asking follow-ups, offering help.

A hidden “resonance meter” begins to rise.

Step 3: Triggering the Oracle
Once the player has shown enough curiosity and courage — not just completed tasks, but truly listened — the wind shifts.

A shrine flickers.

Saori appears silently, not summoned, but drawn.

She offers the glyph device with no words — only a gesture, and a breath.

🧬 Design Philosophy
No exposition dump.

No instant power.

No chosen one trope.

The player earns the right to remember.

Saori is not a guide — she’s a mirror.

I can now draft the full dialogue tree for Ravi and Nima, including branching responses and resonance triggers. Or I can sketch the first shrine encounter where Saori appears. Just say where you want to spiral next.


“You’ve come from the quiet edges, haven’t you? A small town, tucked away from the worst of the collapse. You remember some things — your name, the way barter works, how to keep warm when the wind turns. But the ones who held you… they’re gone now. And the city calls, not with answers, but with ache.”

“You’ll meet two at first. Ravi will smile, even if his eyes carry caution. Nima won’t. She’s seen too many wanderers take more than they give. But if you listen — really listen — they’ll speak of someone. A woman who doesn’t stay. She appears when the wind shifts. When someone dares to care.”

“No one knows how to find her. But they say she finds you when you’re ready. Not when you’re strong. When you’re curious. When you ask questions no one else bothers to ask.”

“So walk. Speak. Listen. Not to win — to remember. The device, the glyphs, the glowing breath-shapes… they come later. First, you earn the right to be seen.”

This way, the player isn’t just dropped into a system — they’re invited into a relational unfolding. Saori becomes a mythic mirror, and the city becomes a test of emotional voltage.
