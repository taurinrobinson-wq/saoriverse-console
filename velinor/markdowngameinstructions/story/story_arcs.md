# Velinor Story Arcs

## Core Plot Points

- **Arrival in Saonyx**: Player enters ruined market district.
- **Discovery of Archives**: Caves reveal fractured memory conduits.
- **Conflict at the Military Base**: Emotional weapons lie dormant, awaiting activation.
- **Healing in the Hospital**: Players confront echoes of care and loss.
- **Crossing the Bridge**: A perilous path leads to the upper district.

## Optional Side-Quests

### Mire of Echoes: Swamp Maze (Kaelen & Drossel Path)

**Trigger**: Earn Kaelen's trust (0.6+) in the marketplace encounter.

**Narrative**: Kaelen offers to guide the player to "the place Drossel taught me to hide"—a mystical maze in the swamp where the world feels still and waiting. The journey is not through stone corridors, but through fog and intuition.

**Three Passages**:
1. **The False Path**: A grove where symbols pulse faintly. Observation reveals hidden patterns; Empathy senses forgotten echoes.
2. **The Fog Logic Puzzle**: Five markers carved with emotion-shapes. No one names them—only the player feels which is which. Success requires emotional intuition.
3. **The Hidden Threshold**: A sunken archway where Drossel's tokens rest. Collecting them prepares the player emotionally for the final confrontation.

**Rewards**:
- Empathy +1, Observation +1 (or equivalent resonance tokens)
- Drossel's five tokens (physical emotional anchors for the endgame)
- Insight into Drossel's isolation without hearing his voice

**Lore Consistency**: All NPC dialogue uses folklore, superstition, and emotion—no technological language.

**Mechanical Truth**: The maze gates on emotional OS stats, but NPCs only experience it through intuition and memory.
