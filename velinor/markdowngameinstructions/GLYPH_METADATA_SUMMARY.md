## Key Findings

### Strengths
✓ All 73 glyphs have complete NPC source information
✓ All glyphs have semantic/emotional tags for OS integration
✓ All glyphs have REMNANTS effect mappings
✓ All unlock conditions populated (100% coverage)
✓ Clear fusion group hierarchy (triglyph through heptaglyph)
✓ All 7 major bosses mapped to fusion chambers

### Integration Points
- **Semantic Engine:** All glyphs tagged with emotional OS categories
- **REMNANTS System:** Trait modulation defined for each glyph
- **NPC Delivery:** 73 NPCs mapped to specific glyphs with unlock gates
- **Boss Progression:** 7 boss chambers with 39 component glyphs
- **Moral Choice System:** Implemented for all 7 fusion glyph receivers

### Progression Gates
- **Item Gates:** Tome of Mustard Seed required for grief-path glyphs
- **Narrative Gates:** All glyphs tied to specific NPC encounters
- **Stat Gates:** Reserved for future stat-based progression (currently empty)
- **Flag System:** Auto-generated flag_set for each glyph acquisition

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Load expanded CSV into game engine glyph system
2. Wire semantic_tags to emotional OS parser
3. Wire remnants_effects to REMNANTS trait modulator
4. Implement boss_gate blocking in chamber access logic
5. Test moral_choice branching for all 7 fusion glyphs
6. Validate fusion_group unlock requiring all component glyphs
7. Integrate unlock_condition checks into NPC dialogue flow
