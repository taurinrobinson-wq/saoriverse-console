Transcendence,1,"Unity, transformation, resolution",Ravi & Nima,Glyph of Contained Loss,Triglyph Chamber (Civic Center Ruins),"This fusion glyph is created when the player combines three glyphs: Glyph of Sorrow (Ache/Nima), Glyph of Remembrance (Presence/Ravi), and Glyph of Legacy (Legacy/Ravi & Nima). These three glyphs unlock access to the Triglyph Chamber, a Corelink emotional server housing 'The Witnessed Crown'—a boss shaped like a weeping, crowned figure that turns away in shame. The player defeats this boss not through combat, but through witnessing: by positioning themselves to see the boss's eye and honoring its grief. When defeated, the boss dissolves into the Glyph of Contained Loss. Behind the victory console, the player sees a faint vision: young Velinor playing with Ophina in the marketplace, laughing and chasing through the stalls. FINAL CHOICE: Take the glyph (massive empathy boost) or Leave the glyph (smaller empathy boost + trust with Ravi/Nima)."
Transcendence,2,"Unity, transformation, resolution",Oracle Saori,Octoglyph of Resonant Paths,Octoglyph Chamber (Saori's Archive),"This fusion glyph is created when the player combines eight glyphs across all emotional categories. These eight glyphs unlock access to the Octoglyph Chamber, the deepest Corelink emotional server, housing the 'Octoglyph Sentinel'—a manifestation of the system's fractured consciousness, mirroring the player's own emotional choices throughout the game. The Sentinel has eight attack patterns, one tied to each glyph category. The player defeats this boss by aligning their emotional resonance with each pattern—demonstrating they have metabolized the emotional frameworks. When defeated, the Sentinel dissolves into the Octoglyph of Resonant Paths. FINAL CHOICE: Take the octoglyph (massive narrative presence boost) or Leave the octoglyph (smaller empathy/trust boost)."
