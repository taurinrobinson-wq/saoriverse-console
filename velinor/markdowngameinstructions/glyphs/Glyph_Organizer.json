Trapped under rubble with a broken leg, Ophina lingered for days while her parents brought food and water, helpless to save her. She died under their watch. This glyph unlocks after the player obtains Kaelen's confession???he witnessed the collapse while attempting a theft and felt powerless to intervene. The player learns that legacy isn't just inheritance of memory; it's the burden of witnessing loss and choosing to stay present afterward. Ravi and Nima stayed in the marketplace as penance, transforming their ache into a cautionary wisdom they share with the player. This glyph is the key to the Triglyph chamber."
