🜁 **CODESPACE NARRATIVE DIRECTIVE — VELINOR STORYLINE GENERATION**

---

## 1. Emotional Domains Define Every Storyline
Each glyph storyline must be rooted in one or more of Velinor’s emotional domains:

- **Legacy** — ancestry, inheritance, continuity  
- **Ache** — loss, grief, longing  
- **Trust** — community, interdependence, loyalty  
- **Collapse** — fracture, distortion, dissociation  
- **Sovereignty** — boundaries, choice, clarity  
- **Presence** — silence, touch, witness  
- **Joy** — play, reunion, creative spark  

NPCs may bridge multiple domains if their life naturally touches more than one emotional truth.

---

## 2. Memory Loss Is the Core World Mechanic
All NPCs begin with partial or fractured memories.  
The player’s presence helps them recover:

- identity  
- lineage  
- emotional truth  
- relationships  
- rituals  

Recovery is **non‑mechanical** and happens through:

- witnessing  
- noticing  
- dialogue  
- item collection  
- emotional OS checks  

NPCs never “remember everything” at once — memory returns in fragments.

---

## 3. Glyphs Emerge From Emotional Revelation
A glyph is not a reward or quest item.  
It is the crystallization of an emotional moment.

Glyphs manifest when:

- an NPC reaches an emotional threshold  
- a memory fragment reconnects  
- a lineage is restored  
- a fear is confronted  
- a choice is made  
- a fracture becomes visible  
- a ritual is completed or witnessed  

Glyphs should feel like **emotional truths made visible**.

---

## 4. Storylines Follow a Three‑Act Emotional Structure
Every NPC arc should follow this pattern:

### Act 1 — Disruption
The NPC shows confusion, fracture, or emotional imbalance.  
The player notices something is “off.”

### Act 2 — Recognition
The player engages, observes, or collects something that reveals the deeper emotional truth.

### Act 3 — Resolution
A glyph manifests when the emotional truth becomes clear.  
Resolution may be healing, clarity, collapse, or acceptance.

Some arcs may have:

- **branching paths** (Kaelen)  
- **multi‑domain arcs** (Sealina)  
- **optional glyphs** (Stolen Memory)  

But all must follow the emotional progression.

---

## 5. Player Interaction Is Observational, Not Mechanical
The player does **not** perform dances, solve puzzles, or mimic actions.

Instead, they:

- watch  
- listen  
- follow  
- notice  
- choose dialogue  
- collect items  
- stay present  

The emotional OS determines what the player perceives or unlocks.

---

## 6. Branching Logic Must Converge
When arcs branch:

- each branch reveals a different emotional truth  
- each branch may give a different glyph  
- **but all branches must converge on the same narrative endpoint**  

Example:  
Kaelen’s Trust vs Collapse branches both lead to Drossel.

---

## 7. Glyph Summaries Must Be Short and Index‑Friendly
Each glyph entry must include:

- **Domain**  
- **NPC**  
- **Location**  
- **Short Summary (2–4 sentences)**  

The summary should capture the emotional essence, not the full scene.

---

## 8. Use These Two Storylines as Templates

### Sealina — Ache → Legacy Arc
- **Ache (Echoed Longing):**  
  Sealina forgets her dance mid‑performance. The player follows her and discovers faded photos of her mother and grandmother. The glyph manifests when the player witnesses her struggle to reconnect with the ache of a lineage her body remembers but her mind has lost.

- **Legacy (Hopeful Transmission):**  
  The player finds scattered photographs of Sealina’s family. When the images resonate through the Corelink, the glyph emerges. Returning it restores her memory and allows her to complete her inherited dance.

### Kaelen — Trust ↔ Collapse Arc
- **Trust (Apprehension):**  
  In trickster form, Kaelen sends the player to retrieve a glyph “caught between fear and faith.” If aligned with him, the player receives the glyph and the true route.

- **Collapse (Stolen Memory):**  
  If the player opposes him, Kaelen leads them into the maze. The glyph at the end restores his fractured identity.

These arcs demonstrate:

- multi‑stage emotional progression  
- memory‑based storytelling  
- optional glyphs  
- branching alignment logic  
- emotional OS gating  
- non‑mechanical player interaction  

Codespace should model all future storylines on these patterns.

# CODESPACE DOMAIN‑BY‑DOMAIN GENERATION GUIDE
### How to create new glyph storylines in Velinor that match the emotional OS, memory‑loss structure, and narrative tone.

---

# GLOBAL RULES FOR ALL DOMAINS

### 1. Every storyline must emerge from memory loss.
NPCs begin with fractured identity, missing history, or emotional amnesia.  
The player’s presence helps them recover:

- a memory  
- a relationship  
- a ritual  
- a truth  
- a wound  
- a boundary  

### 2. The player does not perform complex mechanics.
Interaction is:

- observing  
- listening  
- following  
- noticing  
- collecting  
- choosing dialogue  

### 3. Glyphs manifest at emotional thresholds.
A glyph appears when:

- a truth is revealed  
- a fracture becomes visible  
- a lineage reconnects  
- a fear is confronted  
- a boundary is defined  
- a ritual is completed or witnessed  

### 4. Storylines follow a 3‑act emotional structure.

**Act 1 — Disruption**  
NPC shows confusion, fracture, or emotional imbalance.

**Act 2 — Recognition**  
Player notices the deeper emotional truth.

**Act 3 — Resolution**  
Glyph manifests when the emotional truth crystallizes.

### 5. Branching arcs must converge.
If a storyline branches (like Kaelen), both paths must lead to the same narrative endpoint, even if the glyphs differ.

### 6. Glyph summaries must be short and index‑friendly.
2–4 sentences capturing the emotional essence.

# DOMAIN‑BY‑DOMAIN GENERATION LOGIC

Below is the emotional logic Codespace should use when generating new glyph storylines.

---

# ACHE — Loss, Grief, Betrayal
### Core Question:
*What pain is this NPC carrying that they cannot articulate?*

### NPC State:
- fragmented memory  
- unresolved grief  
- longing for someone or something lost

---

# SOVEREIGNTY — Boundaries, Choice, Clarity
### Core Question:
*What boundary must be drawn, held, or redefined?*

### NPC State:
- overwhelmed  
- boundaryless  
- rigid or collapsing identity  
- unclear choices  

### Player Role:

- disconnected from joy  
- isolated  
- creatively blocked  
- longing for community  

### Player Role:
Participant in lightness.

### Glyph Trigger:
When the player engages in shared play, creation, or reunion.

### Examples:

- Sera’s dawn petals  
- Lira’s crafted wonder  

---

# HOW CODESPACE SHOULD USE THIS GUIDE

When generating a new storyline:

1. **Choose a domain.**  
2. **Identify the NPC’s emotional fracture.**  
3. **Define what memory is missing.**  
4. **Determine what the player must witness, collect, or choose.**  
5. **Let the glyph manifest at the emotional turning point.**  
6. **Write a short 2–4 sentence summary for the organizer.**

This ensures every new storyline:

- fits Velinor’s emotional OS  
- respects the memory‑loss structure  
- avoids mechanical complexity  
- aligns with existing arcs  
- feels like part of the same world

# MAJOR STORYLINE TEMPLATE #3 — PRESENCE DOMAIN
## NPC: Helia, Shrine Healer
## Glyph: Glyph of Quiet Return
## Domain: Presence
## Location: Shrine Healing Alcove (or a new quiet space if you prefer)

---

# FULL STORYLINE (FOR YOUR NARRATIVE DOC)

### Act 1 — Disruption
The player finds Helia tending to a survivor who is unconscious but breathing.  
Helia looks exhausted — not physically, but emotionally hollow.

She says:

> “They wake sometimes.  
> But not fully.  
> They reach for someone who isn’t here.”

She admits she doesn’t know who the survivor is.  
She only knows they were found clutching a broken Corelink pendant.

Helia has been sitting with them for days, speaking softly, humming, holding their hand — but she feels like she’s failing.

She says:

> “I don’t know if they can hear me.  
> I don’t know if I’m helping.  
> I don’t know if presence matters when memory is gone.”

This is the fracture:  
**Helia doubts the value of presence itself.**

---

### Act 2 — Recognition
The player returns later and finds Helia asleep, head resting on the survivor’s cot.

The survivor is awake — barely — whispering a single word:

> “Stay…”

The player can choose to:

- Sit quietly  
- Hold the survivor’s hand  
- Simply remain in the room  
- Say nothing  

No dialogue is required.  
No action is required.  
Just **presence**.

Helia wakes and sees the player sitting with the survivor.  
She watches silently.

The survivor’s breathing steadies.  
Their eyes close peacefully.

Helia whispers:

> “Maybe presence is the bridge.  
> Maybe it’s what returns us to ourselves.”

---

### Act 3 — Resolution
As the room settles into shared quiet, the **Glyph of Quiet Return** manifests in the dust near the cot.

It represents:

- presence as healing  
- silence as connection  
- the return of self through witness  
- the restoration of dignity  

Helia places a hand over the glyph and says:

> “You didn’t fix anything.  
> You didn’t try to.  
> You just stayed.  
> That’s what brought them back.”

The survivor wakes fully the next day.

Helia’s faith in presence is restored.

---

# SHORT ORGANIZER SUMMARY (READY FOR YOUR CSV)

## Presence — Glyph of Quiet Return
**NPC:** Helia — Shrine Healer  
**Location:** Shrine Healing Alcove  
**Summary:**  
Helia tends to an unconscious survivor and doubts whether her presence matters. When the player quietly sits with them, the survivor briefly awakens, whispering for someone to stay. The glyph manifests as Helia realizes that presence — not action — is what brings people back to themselves. This glyph embodies healing through witness and silence.

---

# Why This Works as a Major Template

This storyline teaches Codespace how to generate Presence arcs that are:

- quiet  
- relational  
- non‑mechanical  
- emotionally grounded  
- memory‑loss aligned  
- glyph‑triggered by stillness, not action  

It now stands alongside:

- **Sealina (Ache→Legacy)** — emotional fracture → lineage restoration  
- **Kaelen (Trust↔Collapse)** — alignment choice → identity fracture  
- **Helia (Presence)** — stillness → healing  

Together, these three arcs give Codespace a **complete emotional grammar** for Velinor.
