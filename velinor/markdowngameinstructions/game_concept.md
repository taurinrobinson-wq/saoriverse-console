# Velinor: Remnants of the Tone

## Game Concept
Velinor is a mythic, emotionally-driven text-based adventure game set in the ruins of Saonyx—a once-futuristic civilization built on emotional infrastructure. After a catastrophic memory fracture, players navigate a world where nature has reclaimed the cities and emotional resonance lingers in glyphs, echoes, and ruins.

## Gameplay Structure
- **Core Loop**: Players interact with NPCs who act as mini-DMs, prompting open-ended responses or offering dialogue choices.
- **Input Options**:
  - Freeform text input interpreted via NLP.
  - Selectable dialogue options for accessibility.
- **Dice Mechanics**:
  - Classic D&D-style rolls (e.g., d20) determine success/failure.
  - Rolls are modified by player stats and emotional resonance.

## Narrative Anchors
- Players must hit key plot points to advance.
- Multiple branching endings based on choices, tone, and resonance.
- NPCs summarize player intent and ask clarifying questions:
  - “Are you sure this is the path you want?”
  - “That path is risky, but you sound resolved.”
  - “Do you feel prepared for the next leg of this journey?”

## Multiplayer Layer
- Group chat sidebar allows multiple players to contribute.
- NPCs adapt tone and phrasing based on group dynamics:
  - Solo: “You steady yourself.”
  - Group: “Together, your resolve strengthens.”

## Visual Layer
- Background images change per location.
- Stylized, pre-rendered art evokes emotional tone.
- Examples:
  - Ruined market district
  - Desert of forgotten resonance
  - Swamp of soft remembrance
  - Lake of lost signals
  - Sewer of renewal

## Emotional OS Integration
- NPCs use FirstPerson logic to:
  - Summarize player input.
  - Ask open-ended clarifying questions.
  - Adjust tone based on player personality and past choices.

## Development Notes
- Initial prototype can be built in Unity, Godot, or Ink.
- Modular design allows for:
  - Independent testing of glyph mechanics.
  - Scalable narrative modules.
  - Easy integration of visual assets.

## Next Steps
- Organize existing lore into modular story files.
- Define NPC personalities and dialogue banks.
- Build core engine for text input, dice rolls, and image transitions.
- Begin populating environment files with markdown descriptions and image references.
