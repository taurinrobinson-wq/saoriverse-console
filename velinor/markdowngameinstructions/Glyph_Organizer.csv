Sovereignty,23,"Boundaries, choice, clarity",Archivist Malrik,Glyph of Measured Step,Desert Trial Grounds (Archive Chamber),"Malrik leads the player through a gauntlet of desert ruins???each step destabilizing stone. He teaches measured pace: not fast (panic), not slow (paralysis), but a tempo that matches the ground beneath.

This is endurance as art."
Sovereignty,24,"Boundaries, choice, clarity",Archivist Malrik,Glyph of Boundary Stone,Shifting Sands (Desert Archive),"Malrik teaches the player to carve boundary markers in the desert sand???stones or glyphs that define safe space amid chaos. These markers are temporary; the wind will erase them. But while they stand, they hold. The glyph manifests when the player carves their first boundary marker and watches it hold against the wind for a time. This is clarity through definition: the act of saying 'this far, no further,' knowing full well the boundary will eventually dissolve. Sovereignty isn't permanence???it's the repeated choice to mark and hold and redefine."
Collapse,62,"Memory distortion, fear, the fracture",Archivist Malrik,Glyph of Fractured Memory,Archive Chamber (Ruins Where Inscriptions Blur),"Malrik shows the player chambers where the Corelink system stored emotional data???now corrupted, glitching, displaying fragments of millions of private moments.

The glyph manifests when the player realizes that this is a response to trauma???a broken logic that protects by destroying. Understanding this fracture in reasoning reveals the glyph's truth: fear creates false choices. This is the collapse of empathy under pressure."
