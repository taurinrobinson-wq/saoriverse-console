# NPC Reaction Library: Reusable Dialogue & Responses

## Overview

<!-- md013:ignore -->
A **palette of interchangeable dialogue lines** for NPCs to react to collapse events, player
choices, and marketplace moments. Mix and match based on NPC personality, trust level, and story
context.

## Static NPC Reactions (Desensitized to Collapse)

### Resigned Tone

```text
"Looks like you really are new to the city.
You get used to it. We barely notice it now."

"Another wall falls, another path closes.
We've stopped counting."

"The city argues with itself. We learned to sleep through it."

"You'll understand soon enough. Collapse is just Tuesday here."

"Your shock will fade. Then you'll be like us."
```

### Wry/Dark Humor Tone

```text
"The city's sense of humor is getting darker every day."

"At least it makes the maze interesting.
Keeps everyone on their toes."

"It's not collapse anymore — it's just redecorating."
"You get numb to anything if it happens enough times."
