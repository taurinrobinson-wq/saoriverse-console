# Marketplace NPC Roster: Complete Guide

## Overview

The marketplace is the living heart of Velinor—a dynamic, interconnected community where every NPC
is part of a larger sphere of influence. These eight characters form the emotional and mechanical
foundation of NPC interaction in the early to mid-game.

##

## The Eight NPCs

### 1. Ravi — The Open Watcher

**Appearance**: Tall, broad-shouldered, warm brown eyes, simple earth-toned robes. A scar runs across his left palm—a reminder of market collapses.

**Age**: Mid-40s

**Role**: Marketplace merchant, community hub, Trust anchor

**Personality**: Open-hearted but cautious. He trusts easily, which makes him vulnerable. Recently wary due to thefts in the market.

**TONE Affinity**: Trust (primary), Observation (secondary)

**Relationship with Nima**: Life partner. Their bond (0.8 weight) means player choices ripple heavily between them.

**Tools He Offers**:

- **Map of Echopaths**: Reveals emotional resonance zones on the map. Unlocked at high Trust.
- **Chalk of Certainty**: Marks safe paths before they collapse. Unlocked at high Trust + Observation.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "You look lost. The market does that to newcomers. I'm Ravi. Can I help?"
- *High Trust*: "You listen like few do. I see why she trusts you too."
- *Fractured Trust*: "I thought you were different. I thought you listened. But now… I don't know."

**Quest Hooks**:

- Recover stolen items from marketplace (minor quest)
- Defend market from Kaelen's theft ring (medium quest)
- Learn family history tied to Velhara's collapse (optional, emotional depth)

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Trust**: Shares memory of pre-collapse life, offers guardianship.
- **High Observation**: Player notices his limp; he reveals an old injury from collapse.
- **High Empathy**: He opens about losing family members, shares grief fragments.

##

### 2. Nima — The Guarded Flame

**Appearance**: Slim, intricate braided hair woven with thread, sharp observant gaze, layered robes with sash (once vibrant, now faded). Her hands are stained with herb residue.

**Age**: Early 40s

**Role**: Shrine guardian, spiritual keeper, Empathy anchor, Ravi's partner

**Personality**: Deeply suspicious at first, but once trust is earned, profoundly loving and protective. She carries the weight of pre-collapse memories more heavily than most.

**TONE Affinity**: Empathy (primary), Trust (secondary), Observation (tertiary)

**Relationship with Ravi**: Life partner. She is the emotional ballast to his openness.

**Tools She Offers**:

- **Fragment of the Staff of Resonance**: Amplifies emotional glyphs in boss encounters. Unlocked at high Empathy.
- **Bonded Gesture**: A ritual that deepens resonance with all NPCs in her sphere. Unlocked at very high Trust + Empathy.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "Why are you here? Most outsiders don't come to shrines. Either you're seeking or you're lost."
- *High Empathy*: "I remembered something. A name. Yours, maybe. Like you carried me through memory."
- *Secret Knowledge*: "There's a glyph buried beneath the collapsed shrine. Only those who listen can find it."

**Quest Hooks**:

- Gather sacred herbs for a failing ritual (minor quest, builds Empathy)
- Restore shrine after collapse (medium quest, tied to Sera)
- Recover pre-collapse memories through meditation (optional, mystical depth)

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Empathy + Trust**: Reveals her child was lost to the Corelink collapse. This is her deepest wound.
- **High Observation**: Player notices a locket she wears; it contains the face of a young child.
- **Fractured Empathy**: She closes entirely. Her sphere (Sera, shrine keepers) becomes inaccessible.

##

### 3. Tovren the Cartwright

**Appearance**: Stocky, powerful build, hands stained with soot and calluses, leather apron patched dozens of times. Missing two fingers on his right hand.

**Age**: Mid-50s

**Role**: Practical merchant, tool-maker, Observation-aligned

**Personality**: Direct, no-nonsense, values competence over sentiment. Doesn't trust "dreamers" but respects those who work.

**TONE Affinity**: Observation (primary), Trust (secondary)

**Tools He Offers**:

- **Chalk of Paths**: Marks unstable routes before they collapse. Unlocked at high Observation.
- **Reinforced Boots**: Increases movement stability in collapsing paths. Unlocked at high Trust.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "You're new. Market chews up the unprepared. Don't be unprepared."
- *High Observation*: "You see like I do—cracks before collapses. Good. Stay sharp."
- *On His Missing Fingers*: "Lost them to Velhara's greed. The city took what it wanted."

**Quest Hooks**:

- Repair broken merchant carts (minor, repetitive)
- Find rare materials for wheel reconstruction (medium quest)
- Discover how Tovren lost his fingers—pre-collapse lore (optional)

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Observation**: He teaches player to read the market's rhythm, predicting shifts.
- **Low Trust**: He dismisses the player as soft, cuts off help.
- **High Empathy**: Unexpectedly, softens. Shares story of his family.

##

### 4. Sera the Herb Novice

**Appearance**: Young (early 20s), freckled, green-stained fingers, carries bundles of herbs bound with twine. Her hair is tied back pragmatically. After the Shared Dawn encounter, she carries herself with slightly more openness—less defensive posture.

**Age**: Early 20s

**Role**: Shrine acolyte, ritual keeper, Empathy-aligned, healer-in-training

**Personality**: Gentle, curious, shy initially but warm once trust is built. She carries less cynicism than older NPCs. Post-Shared Dawn: slightly more grounded, less tentative, more willing to laugh.

**TONE Affinity**: Empathy (primary), Observation (secondary), Presence (post-Shared Dawn)

**Tools She Offers**:

- **Flicker Ritual**: Reveals which paths will soon collapse. Unlocked at high Empathy.
- **Healing Salve**: Restores emotional resonance in glyph chambers. Unlocked at high Trust + Empathy.
- **Grounded Presence**: New tool unlocked post-Shared Dawn (high influence with both Sera and Korrin). Allows player to sense when NPCs are emotionally present vs. performing their roles.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "Oh! You're the one Nima mentioned. She doesn't mention many people. That's a good sign."
- *High Empathy*: "I think... I think you understand what loss feels like. It helps, knowing others do too."
- *Teaching Ritual*: "Nima taught me this. It's about stillness, not force. Feel the moment before the break."
- *Post-Shared Dawn (if player honored silence)*: "Thank you for not... making it into something it wasn't. That moment was just what it was. That was enough."
- *Post-Shared Dawn (if player exposed it)*: "You told people. He's been quieter since then. I don't think we can... I need to focus on the shrine work again."

**Quest Hooks**:

- Gather rare herbs in dangerous zones (minor, paired with Nima)
- Teach the player a ritual meditation (optional, deepens Empathy stat)
- Discover Sera's pre-collapse family (optional lore)
- **NEW**: Shared Dawn encounter at market dawn (optional, triggers after 2+ encounters with both Sera and Korrin, Empathy/Trust 50+)
- **NEW**: Post-Shared Dawn reflection dialogue (unlocked if player honored the secret; explores what that night meant for Sera's sense of aliveness)

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Empathy**: She opens quickly, offers guidance, becomes an ally.
- **Low Empathy**: She remains polite but distant, limits help.
- **Pairing with Nima**: Their resonance amplifies. Treat Nima well, Sera softens further.
- **Pairing with Korrin (Post-Shared Dawn)**: If both have high influence post-encounter, they become noticeably lighter when near each other. Their dialogues gain warmth and shared humor. If player exposed the relationship, both withdraw and their joint quest content becomes inaccessible.
- **High Presence (Post-Shared Dawn)**: Sera becomes more vulnerable, more willing to explore questions of what joy feels like, whether brief moments matter, what it means to be surprised by aliveness.

**Influence Modifications (Post-Shared Dawn)**:

- **Path A - Honor Silence**: Sera gains +0.20 influence. She trusts the player's discretion. Later dialogue unlocks where she explores the encounter's meaning privately.
- **Path B - Mention It (Kindly)**: Sera gains +0.10 influence (acknowledge, don't pry). She becomes cautiously friendly but slightly guarded.
- **Path C - Expose/Tease**: Sera loses -0.15 influence. She becomes distant, protective of Korrin, withholds help. Relationship repairs slowly over multiple high-Empathy encounters.

### 5. Dalen the Rusted Guide

**Appearance**: Thin, wiry frame, scarred cheek, cloak patched with metal scraps that clatter when he moves. His eyes are restless, always scanning.

**Age**: Mid-30s

**Role**: Wanderer, risk-taker, explorer, Narrative Presence-aligned

**Personality**: Bold, reckless, charismatic. He sees collapse not as danger but as opportunity. Impulsive but loyal to those who match his intensity.

**TONE Affinity**: Narrative Presence (primary), Observation (secondary)

**Tools He Offers**:

- **Trial Token**: Access to solo resonance chambers. Unlocked at high Narrative Presence.
- **Pathfinder's Mark**: Reveals hidden entrances. Unlocked at high Narrative Presence + Observation.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "You look like you're ready to move. I like that. Stasis kills faster than collapse."
- *High Narrative Presence*: "You walk boldly. Boldness opens doors. Come—I'll show you the unsafe paths."
- *Warning*: "Not everyone survives what I do. Are you ready for that?"

**Quest Hooks**:

- Explore a newly opened collapsed district (medium quest, high risk/reward)
- Discover hidden shrines accessible only to the bold (optional, Narrative Presence reward)
- Learn Dalen's past as a pre-collapse engineer (optional lore, explains his recklessness)

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Narrative Presence**: He becomes mentor-like, opens dangerous quests.
- **High Observation**: He respects caution, adjusts his approach.
- **Low Narrative Presence**: He dismisses the player as timid, offers nothing.
- **Pairing with Ravi/Nima**: Tension. Ravi fears Dalen's recklessness, Nima distrusts boldness.

##

### 6. Mariel the Weaver

**Appearance**: Elderly, stooped from years of work, robes stitched with faded glyphs (she stitches them in), carries a spindle that's never empty. Her eyes are clear and knowing.

**Age**: Late 60s

**Role**: Elder, community bridge, Trust + Empathy anchor

**Personality**: Patient, wise, carries grief without complaint. She remembers the pre-collapse world more clearly than anyone else. Acts as moral center for the community.

**TONE Affinity**: Trust + Empathy equally, Observation (secondary)

**Tools She Offers**:

- **Thread of Memory**: Binds glyph fragments together into coherent memories. Unlocked at high Trust + Empathy.
- **Weaver's Insight**: Reveals connections between seemingly unrelated glyphs. Unlocked at high Resonance.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "You carry yourself like someone who will make important choices. I hope you make them wisely."
- *High Trust + Empathy*: "Come. Sit. I'll tell you what I remember of the world before. It matters that someone knows."
- *On Her Stitching*: "Each glyph I stitch is a memory that won't scatter. They deserve to be held."

**Quest Hooks**:

- Listen to Mariel's stories (optional, non-combat, rewards lore and Empathy)
- Help her repair ancient glyph tapestries (minor quest, rewards Trust)
- Discover her pre-collapse profession (optional lore, reveals she was an architect)

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Trust + Empathy**: She becomes guide to all other NPCs. Her sphere expands.
- **High Resonance**: She reveals deep lore about Velinor and the Corelink.
- **Betrayal of her trust**: She withdraws, but never harshly—just with disappointment.

##

### 7. Korrin the Gossip

**Appearance**: Middle-aged, flamboyant scarf (changes color based on mood; after Shared Dawn, the scarf is noticeably brighter), quick darting eyes, always whispering with merchants. Fidgety hands, fingers always moving. Post-Shared Dawn: sits more still sometimes, eyes softer.

**Age**: Early 50s

**Role**: Informant, rumor-spreader, Observation-aligned information broker

**Personality**: Nervous, always seeking angles, but not malicious—just caught in the economy of information. Gossip is currency, and Korrin is the banker. Post-Shared Dawn: slightly less manic, more capable of genuine quiet, more protective of things that matter.

**TONE Affinity**: Observation (primary), Trust (weak), Presence (post-Shared Dawn)

**Tools He Offers**:

- **Rumor of Routes**: Information about upcoming path collapses. Unlocked at high Observation.
- **Gossip Protection**: NPCs less likely to spread rumors about the player. Unlocked at Trust (hard to achieve with Korrin).
- **Sacred Silence**: New tool unlocked post-Shared Dawn (high influence). Korrin helps player keep secrets, protect vulnerable NPCs, shield moments that matter from community gossip. Paradoxically, the gossip-man becomes the keeper of confidences.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "You're new. Everyone's talking. Want to know what? Costs a glyph fragment."
- *High Observation*: "You notice things. Smart. Thieves are moving south quarter. Ravi doesn't know yet."
- *On Gossip*: "I don't make the news, I just... distribute it. People need to know what's happening."
- *Post-Shared Dawn (if player honored silence)*: "You kept our secret. That matters. In a marketplace full of voices, you stayed quiet. Not everyone can do that."
- *Post-Shared Dawn (if player exposed it)*: "You spread it. I watched people's eyes when they heard. The walls went back up. We're careful now. More careful than we should have to be."

**Quest Hooks**:

- Gather information about merchant movements (minor intelligence quest)
- Discover the source of spreading rumors (medium quest, ties to Kaelen)
- Learn who Korrin once was—pre-collapse role (optional lore)
- **NEW**: Shared Dawn encounter at market dawn (optional, triggers after 2+ encounters with both Sera and Korrin, Empathy/Trust 50+)
- **NEW**: Post-Shared Dawn reflection dialogue (unlocked if player honored the secret; explores what that night meant for Korrin's sense of possibility beyond cynicism)

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Observation**: He shares real intelligence, becomes useful.
- **High Trust**: Almost impossible with Korrin—he fundamentally doubts loyalty. Post-Shared Dawn: becomes slightly more achievable if player honored the Sera secret (Trust can reach 0.65+ instead of ceiling at 0.50).
- **Fractured with Merchants**: His rumors can damage NPC trust spheres. Post-Shared Dawn: he becomes more selective about what he spreads.
- **Pairing with Sera (Post-Shared Dawn)**: If both have high influence post-encounter, their scenes together gain warmth and unexpected tenderness. Gossip stops flowing about them; Korrin actively protects the moment from community commentary. If player exposed the relationship, both withdraw; Korrin becomes protective/guarded; new shared content becomes inaccessible.
- **High Presence (Post-Shared Dawn)**: Korrin becomes more reflective, less performative. He admits uncertainty, explores what it means to be surprised by gentleness, questions whether he's been hiding behind gossip to avoid real connection.

**Influence Modifications (Post-Shared Dawn)**:

- **Path A - Honor Silence**: Korrin gains +0.25 influence (strongest gain). He considers the player an ally in a deeper way. Later dialogue unlocks where he explores the encounter's meaning—gratitude for being witnessed without judgment, confusion about feeling less broken.
- **Path B - Mention It (Kindly)**: Korrin gains +0.10 influence. He appreciates the acknowledgment but remains slightly guarded, aware that knowledge increases vulnerability.
- **Path C - Expose/Tease**: Korrin loses -0.20 influence (greater loss than most NPCs). He feels betrayed not because the secret got out, but because it confirms his fear: vulnerability gets weaponized. Relationship repairs very slowly. He becomes harder, more cynical, more protective of information as his only real possession.

### 8. Kaelen the Cloaked

**Appearance**: Rough, unkempt hair falling across eyes, makeshift cloak stitched from scavenged fabrics (frayed, patched), calloused hands that move with surprising nimbleness. His presence is magnetic but unsettling.

**Age**: Late 20s / Early 30s

**Role**: Suspected thief, test of vigilance, moral complexity anchor

**Personality**: Evasive, charming, dangerous. He speaks in half-truths, always leaving room for misinterpretation. He's not evil—he's surviving.

**TONE Affinity**: Observation (counter), Trust (paradox)

**Key Mechanic**:

- **High Observation**: Kaelen cannot steal from the player. He recognizes the player's watchfulness.
- **High Trust + Low Observation**: Kaelen steals a glyph fragment during encounter.

**Tools He Offers**:

- **Access to Thieves' Gang Optional Quest**: If player earns Kaelen's trust through sacrifice (withholding intel from Captain Veynar), Kaelen opens questline to hunt Drossel (thieves' leader).
- **Shadow's Silence**: A tool that makes the player harder to track. Unlocked at very high Kaelen resonance.

**Sample Dialogue**:

- *First Meeting*: "Eyes forward. Most people don't see me. You do. That's either good or bad."
- *High Observation*: "You see too much. Maybe you'll see me clearly one day."
- *Trusted Kaelen*: "I offered you shadows. You chose to follow. That means something."

**Key Narrative Function**:

Kaelen is the moral crossroads. The player can:

1. **Report Kaelen to Captain Veynar** → Get stolen items back immediately, but fracture Kaelen's
trust forever, lose optional Drossel questline. 2. **Protect Kaelen's secret** → Sacrifice the items
temporarily, but unlock Drossel questline and optional quest to recover items from thieves' lair.

**Resonance Triggers**:

- **High Observation**: Theft is impossible. He admits: "You see too much. I respect that."
- **High Trust + Low Observation**: Theft succeeds. He whispers: "Funny how trust makes hands lighter."
- **Kaelen Betrayed**: He becomes cold, spreads rumors, makes future encounters harder.

**Connection to Drossel**:

- Kaelen is Drossel's lieutenant/scout.
- Earning Kaelen's trust opens the path to Drossel's lair.
- Defeating Drossel and recovering items allows player to restore item holders' trust.

## Dynamic Marketplace Mechanics

### Red X Marks (Path Collapse)

The marketplace is constantly changing. Velhara's structure collapses unpredictably:

- **Red X marks** appear on the map to show impassable routes.
- **NPC tools reveal collapse patterns**:
  - Ravi's Map → sees safe routes
  - Sera's Flicker Ritual → sees collapses before they happen
  - Tovren's Chalk → marks stable paths
  - Dalen's instinct → finds alternative routes

### Encounter Rotation

Each marketplace visit can feel fresh:

- **Different NPCs present** depending on time of day/game progression.
- **Market prices fluctuate** based on sphere stability.
- **Surprise encounters** based on player's TONE stats.
  - High Trust → Mariel appears with lore
  - High Observation → Korrin shares intelligence
  - High Empathy → Sera offers ritual teaching
  - High Narrative Presence → Dalen proposes bold quest

## Narrative Philosophy

Each NPC is a lens through which to understand Velinor. Ravi teaches trust, Nima teaches empathy, Tovren teaches pragmatism, Sera teaches gentleness, Dalen teaches boldness, Mariel teaches wisdom, Korrin teaches information economy, and Kaelen teaches moral complexity.

The marketplace isn't just a location—it's a character itself, shaped by these eight people and how the player chooses to relate to them.
