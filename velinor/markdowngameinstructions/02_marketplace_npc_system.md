# Marketplace NPC System: Trust, Dynamics & Dialogue

## Overview
The marketplace is a **trust economy** where NPCs vary in openness, but all require patience and genuine engagement. Crime wave context creates tension that impacts all encounters.
##

## NPC Archetype 1: Mistrusting NPCs

### Behavior Profile
- **Stance**: Guarded, suspicious, terse
- **Motivation**: Outsiders historically exploit; locals protect resources
- **Trigger**: Player is visibly new, unfamiliar with city rhythms
- **Barrier**: High initial trust cost; requires multiple proof points

### Example NPCs
- **Nima** (Market Guard): Sharp, assessing, protective of community
- **Older Trader**: Weathered, reluctant to share, tests through challenge
- **Shrine Keeper**: Skeptical of outsiders seeking sacred knowledge

### Dialogue Pattern: First Encounter

```
NPC: "You're not from here. Outsiders take more than they give."

Player Options:
A) "I've lost too much to take more."  → Shows vulnerability
B) "I'll prove I can give back."       → Shows commitment
C) "Then don't trust me yet. Just watch." → Shows respect for caution
```



### Trust Building Mechanics
- **Small Acts**: Fair barter, helping with minor tasks, listening without interruption
- **Repeated Engagement**: Must return multiple times; trust is slow
- **Verbal Cues**: Acknowledge their caution, don't push for information
- **Resonance Gates**: Certain glyphs (e.g., [Querrä] for inquiry) unlock deeper dialogue

### Reward States
- **Early Trust**: Vague hints, warnings about dangers
- **Mid Trust**: Fragments of glyph lore, directions to hidden shrines
- **High Trust**: Full stories, personal revelations, alliance
##

## NPC Archetype 2: Welcoming NPCs (Weary by Necessity)

### Behavior Profile
- **Stance**: Warm tone, genuine openness, but cautious pauses
- **Motivation**: Want to connect, but recent crime forced restraint
- **Trigger**: Player shows respect and listening, not extraction
- **Barrier**: Medium initial trust cost; faster progression but emotional guards remain

### Example NPCs
- **Ravi** (Marketplace Guide): Smiles, gives orientation, shares rumors early
- **Healer**: Compassionate, understands grief, slower to warm up to strangers
- **Scribe**: Eager to document stories, seeks connection through narratives

### Dialogue Pattern: First Encounter

```
NPC: "I'd welcome you with open arms, but too many hands here have stolen."

Player Options:
A) "I'm not here to steal. I'm here to listen."   → Shows purpose alignment
B) "I know what it's like to lose trust."        → Mirrors their experience
C) "Then let me earn it, slowly."                → Respects their process
```



### Trust Building Mechanics
- **Early Engagement**: Offer small information early to establish goodwill
- **Emotional Resonance**: Respond to player's grief or questions with empathy
- **Repeated Connection**: Like to see player return; take interest in their progress
- **Shared Context**: Reference the crime wave, acknowledge NPCs' trauma

### Reward States
- **Early Trust**: Orientation, marketplace rumors, initial warmth
- **Mid Trust**: Personal stories, glyph fragments, emotional openness
- **High Trust**: Intimate revelations, alliance, possible adventure hooks
##

## Crime Wave Context

### Worldbuilding Elements
- **Recent Event**: Series of thefts, raids, or community betrayal shook the marketplace
- **Current State**: Even welcoming NPCs now cautious; mistrusting NPCs more hostile
- **Visible Signs**: Locked containers, guards present, fewer open stalls, heightened voices
- **NPC Dialogue Theme**: "Too many hands have stolen"; "trust is a luxury we can't afford"

### Mechanical Impact
- Crime wave increases **initial friction** with all NPCs
- Creates opportunities for player to **investigate or ignore** crimes
- Solving crimes builds reputation faster than normal dialogue
- Can trigger **faction shifts**: helping victims earns trust; exploiting chaos loses it

### Optional Crime Arc
- **Investigation**: Player can ask NPCs about specific thefts
- **Clues**: Hidden glyph fragments tied to stolen goods (e.g., [Ruuñ] glyphs in recovered items)
- **Resolution**: Help recover goods, identify perpetrator, restore trust
- **Reward**: Accelerated trust progression with victims + new glyph access

## Trust Meter (Optional Implementation)

```
Per NPC:
[==========] Mistrusting NPC (10 points to unlock mid-tier dialogue)
[======    ] Welcoming NPC (8 points to unlock mid-tier dialogue)

Actions:
- Fair barter: +1 point
- Listen to full story: +2 points
- Help with task: +3 points
- Resolve crime: +5 points
- Challenge or ignore advice: -2 points
```

## Social Dynamics: The Marketplace Web

### Interconnection
- NPCs **talk to each other** about the player
- Helping one NPC can improve standing with their allies
- Mistrusting one NPC's ally can lower standing with related NPCs
- Trust is not isolated; it propagates through the marketplace community

### Example:

```
Player helps Nima (mistrusting guard) find stolen goods
→ Nima tells Ravi (welcoming NPC) the player is reliable
→ Ravi becomes even more welcoming
→ But Nima's rival, a black market trader, becomes wary
```

## Core Dialogue Principle

**Dialogue is not extraction.** It's *attunement*. NPCs don't open up because player asked the right question — they open up because the player showed they actually care enough to listen.

This means:
- Player options should reflect **care and curiosity**, not tactics
- Empathy unlocks information faster than persuasion checks
- Listening is an active choice, not default behavior
