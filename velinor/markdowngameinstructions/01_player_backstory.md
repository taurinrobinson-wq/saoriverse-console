# Player Backstory & Starting Context

## Overview
The player is a survivor with **partial memory** — grounded enough to function but incomplete enough to seek restoration through glyphs. Their arrival at the city is driven by personal loss, not curiosity.

## Player Memory State

### What They Remember
- **Name**: Intact; they know who they are called by others
- **Basic Skills**: Survival, bartering, keeping warm, navigating wilderness
- **Fragments of Pre-Collapse Life**: Vague impressions, sensations, but not coherent narrative
- **Emotional Core**: Grief; they know something is missing

### What They Don't Remember
- **Emotional Lineage**: Pre-collapse relationships, bonds, sacred vows
- **Corelink Connection**: The depth of their integration or what they lost in the collapse
- **Personal History**: How they fit into the wider world before fragmentation
- **Why They Matter**: Their unique role or significance (if any)

## Backstory: The Small Town Survivor

### Life Before the Journey
- Survived the cataclysm in a **small town**, remote from major population centers
- Lived quietly among a **small group of survivors** who helped each other rebuild
- Had a **primary anchor** — family member, mentor, or beloved — who grounded them
- This anchor person was their tether to meaning and identity

### The Crisis Event
- The anchor person **dies or falls critically ill** with no remedy available
- The small town can no longer sustain the player emotionally
- With no one left to tether them, **staying feels like slow drowning**
- The city becomes not a choice, but a necessity — a last refuge

### The Journey to the Marketplace
- Long walk or passage through fractured landscapes
- Exhaustion mixed with grief and uncertainty
- Arrival as an **outsider entering unfamiliar territory**
- This is their **first exposure** to the rebuilt marketplace structures
- They are both "one of them" (a survivor) and visibly "not one of them" (new to the city)

## Narrative Framing: Opening Monologue

> "You've come from the quiet edges, haven't you? A small town, tucked away from the worst of the collapse. You remember some things — your name, the way barter works, how to keep warm when the wind turns. But the ones who held you… they're gone now. And the city calls, not with answers, but with ache."

## Emotional Resonance

### Why This Works
- **Grounds the player in grief**, not abstract heroism
- **Justifies partial memory**: everyone lost deeper things; the player is just acutely aware
- **Creates empathy bridges**: NPCs recognize the player's loss mirrors their own shame
- **Motivates exploration**: the player isn't saving the world — they're surviving and healing

### Player Motivation Arc
1. **Arrival**: Desperate, grieving, searching for meaning
2. **Early Encounters**: Testing NPCs, learning the city's rules, earning trust
3. **Glyph Discovery**: Realizing that memory recovery isn't abstract — it's personal
4. **Mid-Game Shift**: From "I'm lost" to "I'm recovering"
5. **End Game**: Finding that their grief and recovery interconnect with others' stories

## Design Philosophy

The player is not a **chosen one**. They are a **wounded survivor learning to listen**. Their authority comes from willingness to be vulnerable, not from special knowledge or power.

This makes the empathy mechanic authentic — the player's resonance with NPCs isn't roleplay, it's recognition of shared trauma.
