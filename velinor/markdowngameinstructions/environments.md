# Velinor Environments

## Natural Zones

- **Desert of Forgotten Resonance**
  Sand dunes bury empathy pylons and glyph stones. Heat haze shimmers with faint echoes.
- **Swamp of Soft Remembrance**
  Vines and moss cover collapsed resonance towers. Fog coils around bioluminescent flora.
- **Lake of Lost Signals**
  Still waters reflect broken observatories. Glyph buoys drift aimlessly, pulsing faintly.
- **Caves of Reclaimed Memory**
  Bioluminescent fungi grow along cracked glyph walls. Underground streams flow past broken conduits.
- **Forest of Renewal**
  Nature overtakes ruins, trees sprouting through collapsed towers. Pollution has faded, life thrives.

## Urban/Man-Made Zones

- **Ruined Market District**
  Collapsed stalls and leaning skyscrapers frame the player’s entry into Saonyx.
- **Military Base Ruins**
  Shattered glyphic shields and resonance engines hum faintly in silence.
- **Hospital of Fractured Healing**
  Empathy monitors flicker with static. Murals of care are cracked and faded.
- **Sewer of Renewal**
  Moss and roots break through cracked tunnels. Clean water trickles past glyph residue.
