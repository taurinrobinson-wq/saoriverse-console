## Overview

### Premise
Velinor is a mythic, emotionally-driven narrative game set in the ruins of Velhara (formerly Saonyx), a futuristic city built on emotional infrastructure called the **Corelink system**. After a catastrophic memory fracture, players navigate a world where nature has reclaimed civilization and emotional resonance lingers in glyphs, echoes, and ruins.

### Core Themes
- **Friendship & Sacrifice**: The relationship between Saori and Velinor
- **Memory & Identity**: Scattered fragments of the past
- **Autonomy vs. Unity**: The philosophical divide between the two architects
- **Grief & Reconciliation**: Processing loss and finding meaning in fragments

### Gameplay Pillars
1. **TONE System** (Hidden Stats): Trust, Observation, Narrative Presence, Empathy
2. **NPC Sphere of Influence**: Interconnected relationship networks
3. **Glyph Collection**: Emotional artifacts that unlock story progression
4. **Branching Narrative**: 6 distinct endings based on player choices and resonance

---

## Core Narrative Arc

### The Cataclysm (Backstory)

**25 Years Before Game Start:**

1. **The Architects**: Saori and Velinor co-created the Corelink system to preserve emotional memory across humanity
2. **The Philosophical Split**:
   - **Saori's Vision**: Emotional unification - a hive mind for efficiency and stability
   - **Velinor's Vision**: Emotional autonomy - protected resonance with individuation
3. **The Conflict**: After repeated disagreements, Saori pushes ahead with unification without Velinor's approval
4. **The Collapse**: Conflicting emotions couldn't resolve into resonance; the system fragmented and overloaded
5. **Deaths**: Millions died, including children too deeply fused to survive the severance
6. **The Sacrifice**: 
   - Saori attempts shutdown but needs Velinor to complete the sequence
   - Velinor connects herself to the system to stabilize it
   - Saori successfully shuts down the system
   - Velinor absorbs all fragmentation, shattering her emotional state into **70 glyphs**
7. **The Present**: Saori desperately tries to restart the system to bring back Velinor out of guilt

## Glyph System

### Overview
Glyphs are emotional artifacts scattered after Velinor's sacrifice. They serve as:
- Memory fragments of the Cataclysm
- Keys to unlock chambers and endings
- Resonance amplifiers for NPC relationships

### Types of Glyphs

#### Standard Glyphs (70 total)
- Scattered throughout Velhara ruins
- Found in hidden locations, gifted by NPCs, earned through quests
- Examples: Courage, Wisdom, Empathy, Resolve, Resonance
- Tracked in player's journal

#### Triglyph System
- **Sorrow**: Unprocessed grief echoing through survivor arcs
- **Remembrance**: Memory retrieved, honored, re-anchored
- **Legacy**: Memory transmuted into enduring meaning

**Fusion:**
```
Sorrow + Remembrance + Legacy
    ↓
[Chamber of Echoed Memory]
    ↓
Tear of Integration (triangle with single tear)
```

#### Octoglyph System (Octoglyph of Transcendence)

**Eight Emotional Stages:**

| Stage | Emotion | Visual Glyph | Location |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|
| 1. Infrasensory Oblivion | Ache before awareness | Void with rippling rings | Swamp chamber |
| 2. Sensory Oblivion | Loss flooding senses | [PLACEHOLDER] | [TBD] |
| 3. Primal Oblivion | Raw grief | [PLACEHOLDER] | [TBD] |
| 4. Dislocated Attachment | Love + Fear | Broken heart rejoined | [TBD] |
| 5. Preemptive Severance | Cutting ties first | Blade mid-swing | [TBD] |
| 6. Interruptive Restraint | Holding back | Open palm stopping | [TBD] |
| 7. Held Ache | Carrying pain | Cupped hands with tear | [TBD] |
| 8. Hopeful Transmission | Ache into meaning | Light through prism | [TBD] |

**Fusion:**
```
All 8 Octoglyph Fragments
    ↓
[Honeycomb Panel Integration]
    ↓
Void Octagon (stop-sign with void center)
```

### Glyph Functions

**Narrative:**
- Unlock hidden story paths
- Reveal NPC backstories
- Access boss chambers

**Mechanical:**
- Power emotional tools (Staff of Resonance, Map of Echopaths)

- Influence ending availability

**Thematic:**

## Ending Branches

All 6 endings are **ambiguous** - no "good" ending exists. Every path honors something while destroying something else.

### Ending Requirements

Based on:
1. **TONE Stats** (accumulated throughout game)

**Consequences:**
- Sets initial TONE baseline
- Influences which NPCs approach first
- Affects marketplace encounter rotation

---

#### Choice Node 2: Kaelen's Test
**Location:** Marketplace corridor  
**Trigger:** First meaningful interaction with Kaelen

**Expanding Existing Content:**
1. Find `[PLACEHOLDER]` or `[TBD]` markers
2. Replace with detailed content maintaining established tone
3. Ensure new content integrates with existing decision points
4. Update consequences in related sections

**Tracking Branches:**
1. Use decision point structure for all major choices
2. Document TONE stat impacts
3. Map NPC sphere ripples
4. Note ending availability changes

### For Developers

**Implementing Mechanics:**
1. TONE stats are always hidden from player
2. Use weighted connections (0.1-1.0) for NPC ripples
3. Track glyph collection in persistent player state
4. Gate endings based on stat thresholds AND player actions

**Quest Implementation:**
1. Each choice node should log stat changes
2. NPC reactions should pull from sphere connection data
3. Glyph chambers are puzzle-based, not combat-based
4. Final chamber checks both stats and choices

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] All 6 endings reachable from different stat profiles
- [ ] NPC relationships ripple correctly through spheres
- [ ] Glyphs unlock appropriate chambers
- [ ] Journal accurately tracks encounters
- [ ] Repair paths function for all major NPCs

### For Artists & Designers

**Visual Priorities:**
1. **Character Designs**: 10 marketplace NPCs + Saori + Velinor (young & aged)
2. **Environments**: Marketplace, biomes, 9+ glyph chambers, final chamber
3. **Glyphs**: Visual designs for 70+ glyphs, triglyph symbols, octoglyph symbols
4. **UI Elements**: Journal, map with red X marks, console interfaces

**Tone Guide:**
- Ruins: Nature-reclaimed, bioluminescent details
- NPCs: Diverse, worn but resilient, emotionally expressive
- Glyphs: Abstract but recognizable emotional symbols
- Chambers: Each has unique emotional atmosphere

### For Project Managers

**Milestone Tracking:**
1. **Act 1 Complete**: Marketplace NPCs, basic exploration, journal system
2. **Act 2 Complete**: All biomes accessible, triglyph chamber functional, side quests
3. **Act 3 Complete**: All 8 octoglyph chambers, NPC sphere system fully reactive
4. **Act 4 Complete**: Final chamber, all 6 endings, survivor reactions

**Priority Order:**
1. Core narrative arc (Saori & Velinor)
2. TONE stat system implementation
3. Primary NPCs (Ravi, Nima, Kaelen, Saori, Velinor)
4. Glyph chamber mechanics
5. Ending branches
6. Expansion content (as time allows)

## Quick Reference

### Key Numbers
- **TONE Stats**: 4 (Trust, Observation, Narrative Presence, Empathy)
- **Marketplace NPCs**: 10
- **Total Glyphs**: 70+
- **Triglyph Sets**: 1 (expandable to 4)
- **Octoglyph Stages**: 8
- **Ending Branches**: 6
- **Major Choice Nodes**: 8
- **Biomes**: 4 (expandable to 10)

### Critical Design Principles
1. **TONE stats are always hidden** - Players choose authentically, not strategically
2. **Every NPC is connected** - Relationship changes ripple through spheres
3. **All endings are ambiguous** - No "good" ending, all honor and destroy something
4. **Memory is the theme** - Glyphs, fragmentation, journal, sacrifice all reinforce it
5. **Confrontations over combat** - Emotional refinement, not traditional boss fights
6. **Friendship is the core** - Saori and Velinor's relationship anchors everything
