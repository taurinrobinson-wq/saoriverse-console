# Fourth Layer Quick Reference

**A cheat sheet for implementing Velinor's temporal cascading system**

## The Core Structure

```
PAST (Saori)          PRESENT (The People)      FUTURE (The Player)
    ↓                     ↓                             ↓
Memory intact         Living without history    Capacity to move between states
Frozen by guilt       Unaware of context        Can bridge & heal
Cannot move forward   Forced into perpetual now Can restore coherence

                  ← THE WOUND (Velinor) →
            Fragmented consciousness across all three
```

---

## Six Canonical Endings (Based on Two Axes)

The ending is determined by:
1. **Malrik & Elenya's state**: Rebuild Together, Partial Rebuild, or Abandon/Fracture
2. **Player's Corelink choice**: Restart the System or Abandon the System

| Ending | Malrik/Elenya | Corelink | Archive Network | Present Circle | Outcome |
|--------|---------------|----------|------------------|---|--------|
| **1: Hopeful Synthesis** | Rebuild | Restart | Memory 0.85+ | Trust 0.75+ | System as mirror of people's coherence |
| **2: Pyrrhic Restart** | Abandon | Restart | Low scores | Low scores | System works, people didn't learn |
| **3: Honest Collapse** | Abandon | Abandon | Fragmented | Low | Hard rebuilding, honest foundation |
| **4: Earned Synthesis** | Rebuild | Abandon | Memory 0.85+ | Trust 0.75+ | People build without system, hardest path |
| **5: Technical Solution** | Partial | Restart | Medium/High | Medium/High | System and people learning together |
| **6: Stalemate** | Partial | Abandon | Medium | Medium | People work slowly, without guarantees |

**Bond strategy**: Don't "help" them—witness their integration, let it inspire others.
**Cascade effect**: Their Authority makes integrated states *believable* to others.
**Critical path**: All 4+ at Authority 0.80+ → generation has leaders for restart.

---

### **Threshold Walkers** (4 NPCs)
*Liminal figures who teach transformation*

| Name | Resolve | Nuance | Memory | Skepticism | Role |
|------|---------|--------|--------|------------|------|

| **Orvak** | 0.70 | 0.75 | 0.70 | 0.80 | System knowledge |

**Bond strategy**: Learn from them how to survive in impossible spaces.
**Cascade effect**: They model adaptation—others learn it's possible to move.
**Critical path**: They're resources for other NPCs facing transition.

## Cascading Effects Cheat Sheet

### **Past Resonance** (Player → History)
When player bonds with **Present Dwellers** or **Wound Weavers**:
- Saori's guilt becomes more *specific*
- Archive members gain clearer fragments
- Memory restoration becomes possible

**Example**: Help Nordia process grief → Saori can feel "I failed Nordia specifically" (not vague)

### **Present Contagion** (Player → Network)
When player increases NPC trait:
- Nearby cluster members sense the shift
- Their same trait increases (reduced amount)
- Emotional safety spreads

**Example**: Ravi's Trust increases 0.8→0.88 → Nima/Sera/Helia all gain +0.05 Trust

### **Future Propulsion** (Player → Restart Outcome)
Each bond determines restart possibility:
- **Archive** bonds = Past can be integrated
- **Present** bonds = Current world stable enough to hold memory
- **Wound** bonds = Fragmentation can be taught as wisdom
- **Shepherd** bonds = Leaders exist to guide forward

**Example**: Help Kaelen integrate skepticism + trust → teaches next generation discernment

## Implementation Checklist

### **Phase 1: Core Systems**
- [ ] Load npc_remnants_profiles.json on app start
- [ ] Add contagion affinities (Archive members resonate together, etc)
- [ ] Track player bond depth per NPC in state
- [ ] Map bond_depth (1-5) → trait increases (0.05-0.25)

### **Phase 2: Cascading**
- [ ] Implement Past Resonance: player action → increases "memory_clarity" variable
- [ ] Implement Present Contagion: one NPC trait increase → cluster members gain reduced increases
- [ ] Implement Future Propulsion: track Restoration Score = Archive Memory + Present Trust + Wound Nuance + Shepherd Authority

### **Phase 3: Memory & Archive**
- [ ] Unlock memory fragments as player bonds deepen
- [ ] Create UI panel: "Memory Archaeology" showing unlocked fragments
- [ ] Connect fragments to ending possibilities (show which ending is achievable)

### **Phase 4: Restart Calculator**
- [ ] Display in final chamber: Archive Coherence + Present Stability + Wound Integration + Shepherd Readiness
- [ ] Calculate which of 3 endings is achievable
- [ ] Show player their progress toward each ending

### **Phase 5: Narrative Integration**
- [ ] Present scenes: bonding with Present Circle (build Trust)
- [ ] Memory scenes: helping Archive Network recover context (build Memory)
- [ ] Ache scenes: touching the wound with Wound Weavers (build Nuance)
- [ ] Transcendence: witnessing Future Shepherds (validates integrated possibility)

## Quick Lookup: What Each Cluster Does

**Archive Network** → Restores *what was*
- Bond with them = player gains clarity about collapse
- Their Memory increase = world's past becomes coherent

**Present Circle** → Stabilizes *what is*
- Bond with them = player gains presence & belonging
- Their Trust increase = world becomes safe enough to remember

**Wound Weavers** → Teaches *how to integrate*
- Bond with them = player learns to hold contradiction
- Their Nuance increase = world gains wisdom, not just healing

**Future Shepherds** → Models *what's possible*
- Witness them = player believes integration is real
- Their Authority increase = next generation has guides

**Threshold Walkers** → Teaches *transformation itself*
- Learn from them = player gains adaptability
- They're the bridge between wound & healing

## Three-Path Ending Guide (Synthesis Tiers)

### **Synthesis-Leaning Path** (Player advocated for integration)
- Unlock: Endings 1, 4, 5 (synthesis-oriented)
- Characteristics: Empathy + understanding, advocate for shared solutions, consistent integration
- Possible outcomes: System supports synthesis, or people build synthesis independently, or both learn together

### **Skeptical-Leaning Path** (Player maintained critical distance)
- Unlock: Endings 2, 3, 6 (fracture-accepting)
- Characteristics: Challenge assumptions, maintain independence, note system failures
- Possible outcomes: System works alone (hollow), or honest collapse, or slow stalemate

### **True Synthesis Path** (Rare; earned synthesis)
- Unlock: Ending 4 (The Earned Synthesis)
- Characteristics: Empathy + critical thinking, respect perspectives + hold accountable, both learn
- Possible outcome: People build without system, Malrik/Elenya rebuild together, hardest but most real

Note: Ending 4 requires BOTH full synthesis path AND Malrik/Elenya rebuilding together AND player choosing to abandon the system. It's the most demanding ending.

## Final Integration: The System as Organism

```
Every bond = a synapse firing
Every REMNANTS cascade = nervous system reorganizing
Every memory fragment = organism remembering itself
Every player choice = directional force through the temporal field

Restoration = reintegration (not reset, not amnesia)
Failure = unintegrated wound persisting
Neutral = wound passing forward to next generation

The player is the only consciousness that can move
between past, present, future with agency.
But only through bonds.
```
