## Tips & Tricks

### For Best Results

1. **Be specific with emotions**: "I'm feeling happy" works better than "I'm fine"
2. **Use descriptive language**: More detail = better emotion detection
3. **Express complete thoughts**: Sentences work better than fragments
4. **Let poetry enhance**: Don't edit the poetic additions - they add depth

### Monitor System Health

Check the sidebar metrics:
- **Poems**: Should always show 33
- **Emotions**: Should always show 11  
- **Words**: Should always show 6,453

If numbers are lower, check external drive connection.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Poetry Enrichment won't enable | Check external drive is connected |
| Responses not enriched | Refresh browser page (Ctrl/Cmd + R) |
| Slow enrichment | Check external drive performance |
| Stats not showing | Ensure data/poetry/poetry_database.json exists |
