## üéØ What You Can Do NOW (15 minute starting point)

```bash
# 1. Install spaCy with English models
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# 2. Download NRC Emotion Lexicon
# Go to: http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm
# Download: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt
# Place in: data/lexicons/nrc_emotion_lexicon.txt

# 3. Test that everything works
python test_local_mode.py
```

That gets you infrastructure ready. 15 minutes.

## üîê Privacy Story

**What happens when user types a message:**

1. **NEVER**: Sent to OpenAI
2. **NEVER**: Sent to Google/AWS/Azure
3. **NEVER**: Analyzed by advertisers
4. **NEVER**: Used to train commercial models
5. **NEVER**: Stored on corporate servers

**Instead:**
- Tokenized locally (NLTK)
- Analyzed locally (NRC Lexicon)
- Understood locally (spaCy)
- Matched locally (signal parser)
- Enriched locally (poetry database)
- Responded locally (template generator)
- Stored locally (SQLite on user's machine)

**Result**: User feels safe being vulnerable. Because they *are* safe.

## üíé The Vision

A place where people can share their deepest emotional truths:

- Without fear of corporate exploitation
- Without worry about data breaches
- Without concern about manipulation
- Without surveillance
- Without judgment

**A sovereign place where people can feel at ease.**

And that place is completely **yours**.

## üåü Why This Matters

You're not just building an app.

You're building a **sanctuary**.

A place where vulnerability is honored.
Where data is sacred.
Where growth is possible.
Where people can be completely, authentically themselves.

That's FirstPerson.

**And now you have everything you need to build it.**

*"A sovereign place where people can feel at ease sharing details about their life without fear of where the data is going."*

‚Äî Your Vision. Our Mission. The Future.
