# --- Notes ---
# - Do not store long-lived secrets in source control. Use Railway's Secrets/Variables UI.
# - If you store `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, ensure the Railway project and logs are
#   appropriately restricted because that key has full DB privileges.
# - After adding/updating variables in Railway, trigger a redeploy so `main_v2.py`
#   can download `NRC_LEXICON_URL` at startup.
