---

## 🌒 PHASE 1: Stabilize the Core (2–4 weeks)

### Goal
Lock the foundation. The emotional OS, glyphs, traits, and core mechanics become frozen — this is your physics engine now.

### Workstreams (Can Run in Parallel)

#### Workstream 1A: Generate Full Glyph Corpus (1 week)

**What:** Generate all 118 glyphs with full 3-tier cipher (hint→context→plaintext)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Use glyph generation script: `velinor/tools/generate_glyphs.py` (or create if missing)
- [ ] Generate 75 base glyphs (comfort, crisis, growth, connection, understanding, transcendence)
- [ ] Generate 36 fragment glyphs (intensity, temporal, relational variants)
- [ ] Generate 7 transcendence glyphs (special cipher rules)
- [ ] Validate all glyphs with: `velinor/data/glyphs_complete.json`
- [ ] Run glyph tests: `pytest velinor/tests/test_glyph_cipher.py`

**Output:**
- ✅ `velinor/data/glyphs_complete.json` — 118 glyphs, all tiers defined
- ✅ Test results: 100% passing glyph cipher tests

**Owner:** Backend lead  
**Time:** 5–7 days  
**Risk:** Glyph generation incomplete or semantically weak — **Mitigation:** Pre-define glyph seeds/templates

---

#### Workstream 1B: Run Full Test Suite (1 week)

**What:** Execute all 84 tests. Fix failures. Lock in test coverage.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Run full suite: `pytest velinor/tests/ -v`
- [ ] Categorize failures:
  - Red (breaks gameplay): Fix immediately
  - Yellow (edge cases): Log for Phase 5 QA
  - Green (passing): Maintain coverage
- [ ] Fix all Red failures
- [ ] Document Yellow issues in `PHASE_1_TEST_FAILURES.md`
- [ ] Achieve: 90%+ tests passing (Red=0)

**Output:**
- ✅ Test report: X/84 passing, Y failures categorized
- ✅ All Red failures fixed
- ✅ Yellow issues documented for Phase 5

**Owner:** QA lead  
**Time:** 3–5 days  
**Risk:** Failures reveal unstable systems — **Mitigation:** Fix highest-impact tests first (orchestrator, trait system, coherence)

---

#### Workstream 1C: Freeze Emotional OS (1 week)

**What:** Lock TONE stats, coherence formula, emotional gates, influence mechanics. No more changes.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review & lock: `velinor/engine/trait_system.py`
- [ ] Review & lock: `velinor/engine/coherence_calculator.py`
- [ ] Review & lock: `velinor/engine/npc_response_engine.py` (gate evaluation)
- [ ] Document in: `velinor/EMOTIONAL_OS_FROZEN.md`
  - TONE stat ranges and impact
  - Coherence formula (immutable)
  - Gate types and operators (immutable)
  - Influence calculation (immutable)
- [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off: "This is our physics engine. No changes."

**Output:**
- ✅ `EMOTIONAL_OS_FROZEN.md` — locked specification
- ✅ Stakeholder acknowledgment

**Owner:** Lead architect  
**Time:** 2–3 days  
**Risk:** Stakeholders push for changes mid-project — **Mitigation:** Document *why* each rule exists (emotional coherence principle)

---

#### Workstream 1D: Clean Dead Code (3–5 days)

**What:** Remove prototypes, failed experiments, unused modules.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Audit: `velinor/engine/` — remove prototype files
- [ ] Audit: `velinor/data/` — remove old JSON versions
- [ ] Audit: `velinor/tools/` — remove dev-only scripts (keep clean ones)
- [ ] Audit: `tests/` — remove duplicate/legacy test files
- [ ] Verify no imports break: `pytest velinor/tests/test_import*.py`

**Output:**
- ✅ Codebase is clean (no dead weight)
- ✅ All imports verified

**Owner:** Code owner  
**Time:** 2–3 days  
**Risk:** Accidentally delete something important — **Mitigation:** Back up before, grep for imports before deletion

---

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria ✅

- [ ] 118 glyphs generated and in `glyphs_complete.json`
- [ ] 80%+ tests passing (all Red fixed, Yellow logged)
- [ ] Emotional OS frozen and documented
- [ ] Codebase cleaned of dead code
- [ ] Team alignment: "We don't invent anymore. We execute."

**Phase 1 Duration:** 2–4 weeks  
**Parallelization:** All 4 workstreams can run simultaneously → compress to 1 week if full team

---

## 🔥 PHASE 2: Build the Playable Spine (4–8 weeks)

### Goal
Write the story. Wire the choices. Embed glyphs. Connect collapse to endings. The game becomes playable end-to-end.

### Critical Path
Story Spine → NPC Responses → Collapse Event → Endings Testing  
(Each depends on previous)

#### Workstream 2A: Implement Full Story Spine (2–3 weeks)

**What:** Write all passages, wire all choices, map story flow.

**Files:**
- `velinor/stories/story_definitions.py` — Main content file

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Phase 1 passages (10–15): Opening, introduction, NPC meets
- [ ] Phase 2 passages (20–30): Marketplace, choices, relationship building
- [ ] Phase 3 passages (10–15): Collapse setup, emotional pressure
- [ ] Phase 4 passages (15–20): Collapse event, branching endings
- [ ] Phase 5 passages (10–15): Ending sequences (all 6 endings)
- [ ] Wire all choices with `tone_impact`, `influence_impact`, `gates`
- [ ] Embed glyphs: Each glyph appears 2–5 times in story
- [ ] Test story navigation: `pytest velinor/tests/test_passage_manager.py`

**Content Minimums:**
- Opening hook (1 passage) ✓
- 5 unique NPCs introduced with personality (5 passages) ✓
- Coherence pressure moment (1 passage) ✓
- Collapse event trigger (1 passage) ✓
- 6 unique endings (6 passages) ✓
- ~70 story passages total
- ~150 total choices (average 2–3 per passage)

**Output:**
- ✅ `story_definitions.py` — complete passage graph
- ✅ Story tests passing

**Owner:** Narrative lead  
**Time:** 10–15 days  
**Risk:** Story feels disjointed or choices don't matter — **Mitigation:** Map emotional arc before writing; make each choice meaningfully impact tone/influence

---

#### Workstream 2B: Implement All NPC Response Pools (2–3 weeks)

**What:** Write response patterns for each of 21 NPCs. Minimum viable lines per NPC.

**File:** `velinor/data/npc_profiles.json` — response pool expansion

**Per NPC, write:**
- Greeting (1–3 variants)
- Response to high empathy (2–3 lines)
- Response to high skepticism (2–3 lines)
- Trust gate response (2–3 lines, unique)
- Coherence gate response (1–2 lines)
- Collapse reaction (1 line)
- Pre-ending line (1 line)

**Math:**
- 21 NPCs × ~15 lines/NPC = ~315 lines total
- Not 1000 lines. Lean but functional.
- Each line should embed 1 trait or glyph reference

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create response pool template for each NPC
- [ ] Write minimum viable lines per category
- [ ] Tag each line with traits/glyphs it activates
- [ ] Wire into NPC response engine
- [ ] Test: `pytest velinor/tests/test_npc_manager.py`

**Output:**
- ✅ `npc_profiles.json` — all 21 NPCs with response pools
- ✅ NPC tests passing

**Owner:** Narrative lead  
**Time:** 10–15 days  
**Risk:** NPC lines feel generic or repetitive — **Mitigation:** Define 1–2 unique "voice tags" per NPC, apply consistently

---

#### Workstream 2C: Integrate Collapse Event (1–2 weeks)

**What:** Wire the collapse — the emotional midpoint that shifts game state.

**Files:**
- `velinor/engine/event_timeline.py` — Collapse timing
- `velinor/stories/story_definitions.py` — Collapse passage
- `velinor/data/npc_profiles.json` — NPC reactions post-collapse

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define collapse trigger: Coherence threshold + phase check
- [ ] Create collapse passage: Player forced choice (no backing out)
- [ ] Define post-collapse game state:
  - Which endings are still reachable?
  - How do NPC responses change?
  - Do glyphs behave differently?
- [ ] Wire NPC reactions to post-collapse state
- [ ] Test: `pytest velinor/tests/test_collapse_event.py`

**Output:**
- ✅ Collapse event fully implemented
- ✅ Tests passing

**Owner:** Game designer  
**Time:** 5–10 days  
**Risk:** Collapse feels arbitrary or doesn't impact gameplay — **Mitigation:** Make collapse visibly close off 2–3 endings; force player commitment

---

#### Workstream 2D: Implement All 6 Endings (1–2 weeks)

**What:** Write ending passages for all 6 endings. Make each emotionally distinct.

**File:** `velinor/stories/story_definitions.py`

**Per Ending, write:**
- Final passage (2–3 pages of text)
- Glyph revelations (3–5 glyphs fully decoded)
- TONE state reflection (how did player's choices shape them?)
- Emotional payoff (coherence-based? relationship-based? transcendent?)

**Endings:**
- Transcendence (rare, requires all gates + high coherence)
- Integration (balanced emotional growth)
- Compassion (empathy-driven)
- Wisdom (skepticism + awareness)
- Survival (low coherence, perseverance)
- Dissolution (extreme incoherence, loss of self)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write each ending passage
- [ ] Define ending trigger conditions in `ending_system.py`
- [ ] Add glyph reveals per ending
- [ ] Test ending paths: `pytest velinor/tests/test_ending_system.py`

**Output:**
- ✅ All 6 endings written and wired
- ✅ Ending selection tests passing

**Owner:** Narrative lead  
**Time:** 5–10 days  
**Risk:** Endings feel similar or unearned — **Mitigation:** Each ending should reflect different TONE combinations; make final passage emotionally resonant

---

### Phase 2 Exit Criteria ✅

- [ ] Story spine complete (all passages and choices)
- [ ] All NPCs have response pools
- [ ] Collapse event fully integrated
- [ ] All 6 endings written and wired
- [ ] Story tests passing (90%+)
- [ ] Full game playable end-to-end (via orchestrator)

**Phase 2 Duration:** 4–8 weeks  
**Parallelization:** Workstreams 2A + 2B can start in parallel; 2C + 2D depend on 2A completion

---

## 🌿 PHASE 3: Frontend Integration (3–6 weeks)

### Goal
Velinor-web comes online. API works. UI renders glyphs, NPCs, choices. Game is playable on the web.

### Workstreams (Mostly Sequential — API first, then UI)

#### Workstream 3A: Implement API Endpoints (1–2 weeks)

**What:** Implement all 6 endpoints per `VELINOR_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT.md`

**File:** `velinor/velinor_api.py`

**Owner:** Frontend lead  
**Time:** 3–5 days  
**Risk:** Session handling bugs — **Mitigation:** Test session lifecycle (start → action → save → load)

---

#### Workstream 3D: Implement Save/Load UI (1 week)

**What:** Build UI for persisting game state across sessions.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create save slot UI (10 slots, show timestamp + game state)
- [ ] Implement save button: calls `GameApiClient.saveGame()`
- [ ] Implement load button: calls `GameApiClient.loadGame()`
- [ ] Test save/load flow end-to-end

**Output:**
- ✅ Save/load UI fully functional
- ✅ Persistence tests passing

**Owner:** Frontend lead  
**Time:** 3–5 days

### Workstreams (Non-Blocking — Can Run in Parallel)

#### Workstream 4A: Expand NPC Lines (2 weeks)

**What:** Add more response variants to make NPCs feel distinct and reactive.

**Current:** ~15 lines/NPC  
**Target:** ~30–50 lines/NPC (depth without bloat)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Per NPC: Write 2–3 variants of each response type
- [ ] Add NPC-specific dialogue quirks (speech patterns, references, emotional tells)
- [ ] Add reactions to specific glyphs (glyph resonance)
- [ ] Add post-collapse alternative responses (different tone)

**Output:**
- ✅ NPC profiles feel alive and reactive
- ✅ 21 NPCs with 30–50 lines each

**Owner:** Narrative lead  
**Time:** 10 days  
**Risk:** Lines feel repetitive — **Mitigation:** Use "emotional voice tags" per NPC, vary sentence structure

---

#### Workstream 4B: Add Glyph Resonance Moments (1–2 weeks)

**What:** Moments in story where glyphs appear meaningfully in dialogue/choices.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Map each glyph to 2–5 story moments
- [ ] Add choices that reference glyphs thematically
- [ ] Add NPC dialogue that triggers glyph revelations
- [ ] Embed glyphs in ending passages (final revelations)

**Output:**
- ✅ Each glyph appears 3–5 times in story
- ✅ Glyphs feel like emotional language, not decoration

**Owner:** Narrative lead  
**Time:** 5–10 days  
**Risk:** Glyph embedding feels forced — **Mitigation:** Only add glyphs where thematically relevant; less is more

---

#### Workstream 4C: Polish Endings (1 week)

**What:** Make ending passages cinematic and emotionally resonant.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Per ending: Add sensory details (what does this emotional state *feel* like?)
- [ ] Per ending: Add final glyph revelation (what does player's journey mean?)

## 📋 Timeline Comparison

### 🚀 3-Month Timeline (12 weeks)

**Goal:** Complete, playable, emotionally coherent Velinor — not polished, but real.

| Phase | Duration | Approach |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | 1 week | Minimal scope: glyph corpus only, skip polish |
| **Phase 2** | 2 weeks | Lean story: 70 passages, ~3 choices/passage, minimal NPC lines |
| **Phase 3** | 2 weeks | Simple UI: core components only, no fancy animations |
| **Phase 4** | 0 weeks | **SKIP** — Defer to post-launch |
| **Phase 5** | 1 week | Light QA: run 3 full playthroughs, fix Red bugs only |

**Total:** 6–7 weeks of execution + 1 week buffer = 7–8 weeks

**What This Gets You:**
- ✅ Full game playable end-to-end
- ✅ All systems working
- ✅ All 6 endings reachable
- ✅ Emotional OS functional
- ❌ Minimal voice variety per NPC
- ❌ Simple UI (no animations, minimal polish)
- ❌ No sound

**Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] Phase 1 done
- [ ] Phase 2 done (story complete, crude but coherent)
- [ ] Phase 3 done (API + UI working)
- [ ] Phase 5 light (no blocking bugs)

**Risks:**
- **Scope creep:** Will kill this timeline. No changes once Phase 2 starts.
- **API bugs:** Will block Phase 3. Test API early with cURL.
- **Story coherence:** Hard to fix at end. Lock story concept before writing.

---

### 🎯 6-Month Timeline (24 weeks) — RECOMMENDED

**Goal:** Polished game with good content and solid systems.

| Phase | Duration | Approach |
|-------|----------|----------|

| **Phase 3** | 3–4 weeks | Solid UI: all components, basic animations, good UX |
| **Phase 4** | 3–4 weeks | Content + polish: expanded NPC lines, glyph resonance, ending refinement |
| **Phase 5** | 2–3 weeks | Full QA: 5+ playthroughs, edge case testing, performance tuning |

**Total:** 17–21 weeks of execution + 3–5 weeks buffer = 20–26 weeks

**What This Gets You:**
- ✅ Complete, playable, emotionally coherent game
- ✅ Good character voice variety (each NPC distinct)
- ✅ Polished UI with good UX
- ✅ Glyph system feels meaningful
- ✅ Endings feel earned and emotional
- ✅ Minimal but effective sound
- ✅ Stable, well-tested, cross-browser compatible

**Launch Checklist:**

## 🚨 Critical Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | 3-Month | 6-Month | 12-Month | Mitigation |
|------|---------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Scope creep** | 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟡 HIGH | 🟢 LOW | Freeze emotional OS Day 1. No new systems. |
| **API bugs block frontend** | 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟡 HIGH | 🟢 LOW | Test API with cURL before frontend starts. |
| **Story incoherence** | 🟡 HIGH | 🟢 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Write story outline + emotional arc first. |
| **NPC lines too generic** | 🟡 HIGH | 🟢 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Define voice tags per NPC; enforce consistency. |
| **Test failures mid-project** | 🟡 HIGH | 🟢 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Fix all tests in Phase 1. |
| **Performance issues** | 🟡 HIGH | 🟢 MEDIUM | 🟢 LOW | Benchmark early; optimize in Phase 5. |
| **Ending feels unearned** | 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟡 HIGH | 🟢 LOW | Playtesting from Phase 3 onward. |

## 🎬 Execution Principles

### 1. **Lock, Then Execute**
Lock emotional OS, story skeleton, and API contract *first*.  
Then execute without revisiting.  
Revisiting kills velocity.

### 2. **Build Vertically**
Go from "start" to "end" for one path first.  
Then expand breadth (more NPCs, more glyphs, more endings).  
Never build all features halfway.

### 3. **Test Early, Test Often**
Run full playthroughs starting Phase 3.  
Find issues while they're cheap to fix.  
Don't wait until Phase 5 to discover game-breaking bugs.

### 4. **Defer Polish**
Phases 1–3: Functional > Beautiful  
Phase 4: Add beauty  
Phase 5: Refine  
In 3-month timeline: Skip Phase 4 entirely.

### 5. **Define "Done"**
Per phase: What does success look like?  
Be ruthless: If it's not in "done", it's not getting done.  
Defer nice-to-haves to post-launch.

## 🎯 Next Steps: Pick Your Timeline

1. **Read this document** ← You are here
2. **Align with stakeholders** — Which timeline? Which scope?
3. **Lock Phase 1** — Freeze emotional OS, commit to glyph generation
4. **Start Week 1** — Phase 1, Workstream 1A (glyph corpus)
5. **Weekly standups** — Use template above, track velocity

## Appendix: Detailed Task Breakdown

### Phase 1, Workstream 1A: Glyph Corpus Generation

**Subtasks:**
- [ ] Set up glyph generation script (if not exists)
- [ ] Generate 75 base glyphs:
  - [ ] 12 comfort glyphs
  - [ ] 12 crisis glyphs
  - [ ] 12 growth glyphs
  - [ ] 12 connection glyphs
  - [ ] 12 understanding glyphs
  - [ ] 3 transcendence glyphs
- [ ] Generate 36 fragment glyphs:
  - [ ] 18 intensity variants
  - [ ] 9 temporal frames
  - [ ] 9 relational contexts
- [ ] Generate 7 transcendence glyphs
- [ ] Validate all 118 glyphs in `glyphs_complete.json`
- [ ] Run glyph tests and fix failures
- [ ] Spot-check glyph semantics (do 3-tiers make sense?)

**Time Estimate:** 40–56 hours

### Phase 2, Workstream 2A: Story Spine Implementation

**Subtasks by Phase:**

**Phase 1 (Intro):**
- [ ] Opening passage: Welcome to Velinor
- [ ] 5 NPC intros (1 passage each)
- [ ] 5 first-choice passages (where do you go next?)
- [ ] Narrative hook: Establish mystery

**Phase 2 (Marketplace):**
- [ ] 20 choice/consequence passages
- [ ] 5 NPC deepening moments
- [ ] Relationship branching (different NPCs, different paths)

**Phase 3 (Collapse Setup):**
- [ ] Emotional pressure builds
- [ ] Foreshadowing collapse
- [ ] Coherence reaches threshold

**Phase 4 (Collapse + Branching):**
- [ ] Collapse event passage
- [ ] Post-collapse split: Which NPCs support you? Which turn away?
- [ ] 3–4 branching paths toward endings

**Phase 5 (Endings):**
- [ ] Ending passages (6 total, 2–3 pages each)
- [ ] Glyph revelations per ending
- [ ] Emotional payoff

**Time Estimate:** 80–120 hours
