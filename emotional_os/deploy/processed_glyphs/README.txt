This folder is a ritual archive for metabolized glyph notes. Files here have been parsed, annotated, and integrated into the emotional OS system.

Each file reflects a threshold momentâ€”legacy honored, complexity preserved, voltage metabolized.

# stewardship: archive lineage, maintain clarity, enable system parsing.
