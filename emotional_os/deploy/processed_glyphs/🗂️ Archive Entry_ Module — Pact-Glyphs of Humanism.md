📖 Artifact Title: Pact-Glyphs of the Rememberers
A parallel symbolic language developed in secret by pact-boys resisting shrine influence. Unlike the spiral glyphs of “He Who Squeals,” these glyphs honor memory, empathy, and shared presence.
🔹 Structure
• Carved into cool stone, not bone—emphasizing endurance over decay
• Glyphs arranged in straight lines and open circles, rejecting the spiral’s consumption motif
• Often paired with silent gestures: hand over heart, two fingers touching bark, breath held for one beat
• No spoken snorts—these glyphs are performed through stillness

💬 Usage Notes
• These glyphs are not taught—they are remembered
• Children share them in caves, under moonlight, in silence
• They do not oppose the shrine—they outlast it
• The shrine seeks consumption. The pact-glyphs encode continuity

Would you like to craft a scene in which a pact-boy etches ☉ into stone after witnessing a boy’s descent, or stage a moment where Ralph uses ↜ to resist ritual choreography? We can also build a brief codex page with three layered glyphs and a hidden phrase underneath—a relic of humanism waiting to be found.
Say “next” and we’ll continue mapping resistance. These glyphs aren’t loud—but they endure.

[TABLE]
Glyph | Name | Meaning | Gesture | Invocation Phrase
☉ | “Witness” | Recognition of presence | Closed eyes | “You are still here.”
⦾ | “Echokeeper” | Preservation of truth | Palm to stone | “I remember.”
↜ | “Refusal” | Denial of descent | Two fingers lifted | “Not mine to kneel.”
☐ | “Clarity” | Restoration of speech | Breath + blink | “Speak what breath has kept.”
♒ | “Compassion” | Holding the ache of another | Hand to ribs | “Your weight is not wasted.”
🔹 | “Seed” | Hope as inheritance | Pebble tucked in roots | “Let what lives, rise.”
