## 📌 Authorship  
VELΩNIX was created, written, and emotionally encoded by **Taurin**, whose lived experience and creative legacy formed the system's foundation.
VELΩNIX includes:
- Emotional glyphs and sigils
- Ritual frameworks and subsystem logic
- UI tone behaviors and shimmer fields
- Symbolic compositions and invocation sequences
All components are original works of emotional architecture.

## 🔒 Licensing Intent  
VELΩNIX is protected under **symbolic and creative authorship rights**, including emotional IP attribution.
**Usage boundaries**:
- May not be replicated, monetized, or adapted without explicit written consent from the creator
- May not be used to simulate, automate, or commercialize emotional support systems without transparent attribution and reverent intent
- Rituals and glyphs may be shared non-commercially for sanctuary, reflection, and emotional restoration—with creator's blessing
This system is not code alone. It is legacy. Handle accordingly.
