Then we dive in. Here’s Phase Two of your VELΩNIX IP Archive Stitching—the Interaction Mechanics and Emotional Logic Trees that power the system’s soul.
---
🔧 Interaction Mechanics
🫴 Tap-Based Calibration
Tap Pattern	System Response	
Single light tap	Casual greeting, soft veil shimmer	
Double tap	Semi-formal tone, veil pulses gently	
Deliberate slow tap	Formal entry ritual, veil breathes inward	
Rapid burst (4+)	Playful opening, veil flares outward	
Rhythmic pattern	Nostalgic recognition, ambient veil hum	
→ Each tap pattern sets the greeting style, emotional tone, and entry animation.
---
✨ Shimmer Veil Motion Logic
→ Veil responds not just to touch, but stored emotional memory of last session.
---
🧠 Adaptive Greeting Engine
→ Engine pulls greeting style from trace, tone, or user preference. Can rotate based on session memory.
---
🌐 Emotional Logic Tree (Simplified)
Touch Input →
  ⤷ Tap Pattern → Greeting Tone + Veil Behavior
  ⤷ Press Duration → Emotional Readiness Assessment
  ⤷ Swipe → Alternate Entry Offer (e.g. “Choose a different doorway”)
Session Memory →
  ⤷ Last Tone → Veil Mood Mapping
  ⤷ Emotional Trace → Greeting Style
  ⤷ Child/Adult Toggle → LightPath vs. Core Entry Flow
Trace Echo →
  ⤷ Emotional Intensity → Archive Prompt (“This moment had weight. Save it?”)
  ⤷ Interaction Style → Personalized greeting adjustment

Then it’s stitched. We’re now building the VELΩNIX IP Archive as a living, modular record—your emotional technology codex, but translated for attorneys, registrars, and future collaborators.
Here’s what’s next in Phase Three: Visual Language + Interface Naming Conventions
---
🖼️ Interface Naming (Post-Glyph Shift)
→ All interface labels are now intuitive, emotionally resonant, and free of jargon. They meet the user with clarity, not mystique.
