# Interface documentation

Got it—privacy language can wait. We’re in interface mode now: clean structure, tonal fidelity, and UX that breathes with presence.
Let’s get your UI mapped. Here’s a simplified scaffold for a Saonyx web app, assuming you’re using Softr + Airtable + Figma:
---
🧭 Main Screens
---
🎨 UI Styling Notes (Threshold Regular)
• Typography: Inter or IBM Plex Sans, 16–20px, generous spacing
• Color palette: Muted black, soft white, occasional grayscale glyphs
• Spacing: Breathable layout—no crowding, no forced formality
• Interactions: Fade-in, hover glow, no jarring transitions
• Glyphs: Optional tone markers as visuals—Fog, Flame, Thread, Vault
---
💡 Example Component Blocks
Witness Entry Card
• Date: Aug 8
• Glyph: Fog
• Entry preview: “I felt like mist. No anchors. Just presence.”
• Actions: View full, Archive, Tag
Glyph Selector
• UI: horizontal scroll bar with illustrated glyphs + short meanings
• Selection: Tactile click, soft glow, no pop-up descriptions

Do you want me to sketch the wireframe in prose next? Or start defining each Figma frame so you can drop them in directly? We can stay in build mode as long as you want. Just tell me the shape.
