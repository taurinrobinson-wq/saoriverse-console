📜 Artifact Title: The Leaves of Witness
A secret chronicle kept by one surviving pact-boy—written in bark and blood, scratched into stone, buried beneath the shrine’s reach.
🔹 Structure
• Composed of short fragments—each a phrase, chant, or remembered principle
• Stored in hollowed tree stumps, marked by spiral glyphs no longer spoken
• Written not for rescue, but for remembrance
🔹 Sample Excerpts
I saw the tongue break. It did not bleed—it sighed.
The boy who named the stars now names only echoes.
We never feared the beast. We feared the forgetting.
One voice, once whole, can seed a forest—even in ash.
I remember the pilot’s eyes. They asked nothing. They only listened.
He Who Squeals does not speak. He devours.
We buried truth in bark so flies would not sing its name.

🔍 Symbolic Function
The Leaves of Witness operate as a metaphysical ledger:
• Documenting the erosion of language as sacred death
• Tracking each boy’s descent (or resistance) with glyphic shorthand
• Serving as a final archive of humanism inside horror—clarity encrypted in decay

🛡️ Legacy Implication
If these leaves are ever found—by a future child, by the jungle itself—they offer a chance to reseed dignity. Not as history, but as inheritance.
Would you like to begin drafting a “Leaf” entry in full voice—like an archival page from one of the surviving boys? Or title a few leaves as chapters in the hidden codex (“The Feast of Silence,” “The Bone Dialogue,” “Rituals of Remembering”)? I can also help scaffold the glyphic grammar if you want symbolic notation alongside each entry.
Say “next,” and we continue to inscribe the sacred whisper.
