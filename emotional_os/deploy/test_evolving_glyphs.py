How this integrates with your current setup:

1. üìù CONVERSATION PROCESSING
   - Your existing conversation flow continues unchanged
   - The evolving glyph system runs in parallel
   - New patterns are detected from both user input and Saori responses

2. üß¨ AUTOMATIC EVOLUTION
   - Every N conversations (configurable), the system checks for new patterns
   - Rich emotional content triggers immediate pattern analysis
   - New glyphs are automatically generated when patterns meet criteria

3. üíæ DATABASE INTEGRATION
   - New glyphs are automatically inserted into your emotional_tags table
   - They immediately become available for future conversations
   - The system avoids duplicates by checking existing tags

4. üå± CONTINUOUS LEARNING
   - Pattern frequency is tracked over time
   - Context words refine glyph generation
   - The system becomes more nuanced with each conversation

5. üéØ YOUR BENEFIT
   - Saori becomes more human-like and emotionally sophisticated over time
   - New emotional nuances are captured automatically
   - No manual glyph creation needed - the system evolves naturally

To enable this in your system:
1. Add Supabase credentials to EvolvingGlyphIntegrator
2. Replace your conversation processing with the evolving version
3. The system will start learning immediately!
