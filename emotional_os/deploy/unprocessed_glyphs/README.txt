unprocessed_glyphs/
---
This folder is a ritual capsule for raw glyph notes, fragments, and legacy transmissions. Place downloaded Google Docs, markdown, or text files here before ingestion.

Each file is metabolized into system-readable glyph objects and annotated lineage. Upon successful processing, files are moved to processed_glyphs/.

# stewardship: preserve complexity, honor legacy, metabolize voltage.
