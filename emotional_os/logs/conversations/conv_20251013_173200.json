      "content": "right now I'm dealing with a lot of grief. My marriage of 10 years ended back in April of this year. But really had been on a decline for years with a lot of fighting. We are filing the final paperwork today. I also started a new relationship with a wonderful woman mid-August. Her and I have talked about marriage and kids and both feel like that's where the relationship is headed. She's 40, so even though the relationship is fresh I am cognizant of the need to move things along",

      "content": "It sounds like you’re carrying quite a bit right now. Grief from your marriage ending is heavy, especially after a decade of shared life. It’s completely normal to feel a mix of emotions as you file those final papers. Closure can be a strange and bittersweet thing.\n\nOn the other hand, starting a new relationship can feel both exciting and daunting, especially when you've had a tough past. It’s great that you’ve found someone you connect with and can envision a future together. Just remember: it’s okay to take it slow, even if time feels like it’s pressing. \n\nBalancing these feelings—grief for what was and hope for what could be—can be tricky. It’s perfectly fine to honor both sides. How are you feeling about everything?",
