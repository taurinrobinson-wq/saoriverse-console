# Phase 2 — Quick Reference (Placeholder)

A one-page quick reference for developers and reviewers.

What to look for
- Entrypoints: `main_v2.py`, `emotional_os/deploy/modules/ui.py`
- Extraction service: `supabase/functions/saori-fixed/index.ts`
- Persistence DDL: `sql/create_conversation_history_tables.sql`

Fast checks
- Tests: `pytest` (run locally)
- DB: Apply DDL to Supabase using service_role key

TODO
- Populate with short snippets and common troubleshooting items.
