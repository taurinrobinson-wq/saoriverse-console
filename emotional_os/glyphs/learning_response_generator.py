Learning Response Generator

Crafts responses that:
1. Genuinely answer the user's emotional inquiry
2. Subtly reinforce/train the emotional language patterns
3. Validate the emerging glyph without being obvious
4. Create implicit feedback loops

Philosophy: The response IS the training. Users never know they're teaching the system.
The system learns through authentic emotional communication.
