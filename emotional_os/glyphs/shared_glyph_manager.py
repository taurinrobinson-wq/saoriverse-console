Shared Glyph Manager

Handles the architecture that allows:
- ALL users contribute to a SHARED glyph database
- But EACH user sees a personalized experience
- Glyph versioning and consensus weighting
- User segregation at query level, not database level

Key insight: Separation happens in the queries and presentation layer,
not in the storage layer. One unified glyphs.db, but infinite user views.
