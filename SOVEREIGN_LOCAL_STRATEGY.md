"""
SOVEREIGNTY & SAFETY

When people share vulnerable moments about their life:
- Their losses, their fears, their shame
- Their broken relationships, health struggles
- Their suicidal ideation, their trauma

They deserve a space where:
✓ Their data is THEIRS
✓ No corporation owns their vulnerability
✓ No AI training dataset learns from their pain
✓ They can trust the technology
✓ The system is THEIRS

FirstPerson Local Mode is THAT SPACE.

Not because privacy is a feature.
But because privacy is a right.

And emotional safety is sacred.
