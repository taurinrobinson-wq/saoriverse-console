            "Hope is the thing with feathers -\nThat perches in the soul -\nAnd sings the tune without the words -\nAnd never stops - at all -",
            "Do not go gentle into that good night,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.",

            "The haunted palace in the air,\nUpon a thought I scarce dare speakâ€”\nA mystery that fills with care\nThe hearts of those who timidly peek\nInto the darkness all around,\nWhere strange and awful terrors sound.",
            "Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten loreâ€”\nWhile I nodded, napping suddenly, there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.",

            "When all thy mercies, O my God,\nMy rising soul surveys,\nTransported with the view, I'm lost\nIn wonder, love, and praise.",

            "O, I am sick when I do look on thee.\nThy face, so odious to my mind,\nRepels the very sight of thee;\nIn thee no beauty can I find,\nBut only loathing, deep and strong,\nFor all the falsehood rife in thee.",
            "This foul cesspool of humanity,\nThis pit of lies and vanity,\nThis sink of all that's base and vile,\nCan scarce be borne by soul or style.",
