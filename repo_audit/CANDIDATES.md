# Repository Audit, Candidate Files/Dirs for Archival

This file is an automated audit listing candidate files and directories that look like developer tools, demos, one-off scripts, or large generated artifacts that are safe to archive (move to an `archive/` folder) if you want a smaller, tidier main tree. This is a non-destructive report only, no files were moved by this audit.

Use this report as a starting point. After you review, I can either (A) move selected items into `dev_archive/` and commit the move, or (B) create `.gitignore` entries for large/generated artifacts.

##

Summary of candidates (high level)

- Developer scripts and utilities: `scripts/`, `dev_tools/`, `tools/`
- Demos and examples: `demos/` and files prefixed with `demo_` or in `demos/`
- Top-level one-off utilities: `phase_*`, `generate_scenario_report.py`, `glyph_generator.py`, `learning/*`
- Large/generated assets: `emotional_os/glyphs/glyphs.db` (tracked DB), `data/lexicons` backup files
- Helper templates and local-run helpers (if you prefer them out of root): `railway.env.template`, `run_local.sh`, `scripts/download_nrc_lexicon.py`, `scripts/git-push-timeout.sh`

Concrete candidate list (examples pulled from a repo scan):

- scripts/ (many ingestion, migration, and util scripts)
  - scripts/download_nrc_lexicon.py
  - scripts/enrich_runner.py
  - scripts/migrate_supabase.py
  - scripts/utilities/* (many small utilities)

- dev_tools/ (developer-only helpers)

- tools/ (additional tooling; often one-off)

- demos/ (demo code and example scripts)

- learning/ and phase_* files (experiments and batch jobs)
  - phase_1_generator.py
  - phase_2_pruner.py
  - phase_3_generator.py
  - phase_4_id_deduplicator.py
  - phase_4_ritual_tester.py

- Top-level scripts that look one-off or exploratory
  - glyph_generator.py
  - generate_scenario_report.py
  - evolving_glyph_integrator.py
  - glyph_effectiveness_validator.py

- Large tracked artifacts to consider removing from git (or put under LFS)
  - `emotional_os/glyphs/glyphs.db`, SQLite DB (~MBs); consider moving to `data/` and adding to `.gitignore` or using Git LFS.
  - `data/lexicons/*.bak*`, backup files; these should be ignored (we removed some during the earlier cleanup).

- Docs scattered in root
  - Several README/notes/other markdown files live in the repo root. Consider consolidating under `docs/` with a top-level `README.md` linking into it.

What I did NOT include as candidates

- `emotional_os/deploy/modules/ui.py` and other `emotional_os` runtime modules, these appear to be required by `main_v2.py` and the Streamlit app.
- Tests under `tests/` and `supabase/tests/`, keep them as they exercise the codebase.

Guidance & next steps (safe workflow)

1. Review this list and mark items you want archived.
2. I will create a `dev_archive/` folder at repo root and move selected directories there with `git mv` (so history is preserved). Example:

   ```bash
   git mv scripts dev_archive/scripts
   git commit -m "chore: archive dev scripts to dev_archive/scripts"
   ```

3. Add `.gitignore` entries for generated and backup files (e.g., `data/lexicons/*.bak*`, `*.db` if appropriate) and commit.
4. Optionally reorganize docs into `docs/` and update top-level `README.md` with a short TOC.
5. Run the test-suite after each change and fix any import issues (moving modules within packages may require adjusting imports).
6. Optionally: add a short developer README describing where to find helper scripts, how to run `make test-local`, and how to run cleaning helpers.

Quick commands to preview usage (no-op, safe):

```bash

# list candidate folders
ls -la scripts dev_tools tools demos || true

# preview size of large files
du -sh emotional_os/glyphs/glyphs.db || true

# show git-tracked large files (helpful for decisions)
git ls-files -z | xargs -0 du -sh | sort -h | tail -n 30
```

If you'd like, I can generate a PR/branch that performs the archive moves for a small group (for example: `scripts/`, `dev_tools/`, `tools/`) and run tests to confirm nothing breaks. Tell me which subset you want archived first or approve me to propose a default set.
