# WHAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED
# ============================================================================

"""
1. GLYPH LEARNER MODULE (glyph_learner.py - 350 lines)
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Responsibility: Generate new glyphs when signal detected but no existing match
   
   Key Methods:
   • analyze_input_for_glyph_generation() 
     → Takes emotional input and returns complete glyph candidate
   • log_glyph_candidate()
     → Stores candidate to database
   • log_glyph_usage()
     → Tracks which glyphs are used across system
   • promote_candidate_to_production()
     → Moves validated glyph to core lexicon
   • get_learning_stats()
     → System learning statistics

   What it does:
   ✓ Extracts emotional language patterns from user input
   ✓ Analyzes with NRC Emotion Lexicon
   ✓ Finds semantically similar existing glyphs
   ✓ Generates candidate glyph name, description, signal mapping
   ✓ Maps signals to appropriate gates (1-9)
   ✓ Calculates confidence score (0.5-0.95)
   ✓ Logs all metadata to database

   Example:
   Input: "I feel caught between who I pretend to be and who I really am"
   Output: Candidate glyph named "Fractured Identity" with full mappings
   
   Confidence: 0.75 (ready for immediate use, pending consensus validation)

2. LEARNING RESPONSE GENERATOR (learning_response_generator.py - 400 lines)
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Responsibility: Craft responses that answer emotionally AND train the system
   
   Key Methods:
   • generate_learning_response()
     → Complete response that answers + trains
   • generate_multi_glyph_response()
     → When multiple glyphs could apply
   • craft_insufficient_glyph_response()
     → When glyph is incomplete
   • generate_response_that_teaches_gate_mapping()
     → Response that trains gate intensity levels
   • create_training_response()
     → Convenience wrapper

   What it does:
   ✓ Selects response template based on emotional tone (8 tones)
   ✓ Inserts key emotional terms from user input (reinforcement)
   ✓ Adds implicit validation prompts (feedback gathering)
   ✓ References glyph names/descriptions (training signal)
   ✓ Crafts language that validates emerging patterns

   Response Templates (8 emotional tones):
   • Grief: "There's a depth to what you're carrying..."
   • Longing: "I hear the yearning in what you're saying..."
   • Containment: "You're holding space for complexity..."
   • Insight: "You've arrived at something true..."
   • Joy: "Let it exist in its fullness..."
   • Devotion: "Real devotion always has a cost..."
   • Recognition: "You're asking to be known..."
   • Unknown: "You're in territory without a map..."

   Example Response:
   "You're doing something quiet but powerful: maintaining distance between 
    your performing self and your true self. That tension—it's evidence of 
    integrity.
    
    [Fractured Identity]
    
    When you feel known, what opens?"
    
   Training signals embedded:
   ✓ Echoes exact emotional vocabulary ("tension", "performing", "distance")
   ✓ Validates the pattern (names it appropriately)
   ✓ References glyph (reinforces association)
   ✓ Ends with prompt (gathers feedback)

3. SHARED GLYPH MANAGER (shared_glyph_manager.py - 500 lines)
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Responsibility: Manage global learning while maintaining per-user segregation
   
   Key Methods:
   • get_glyphs_for_user()
     → User-specific glyph ordering based on personal adoption history
   • record_glyph_adoption()
     → User adopted glyph → updates consensus
   • create_glyph_version()
     → Track how glyphs evolve over time
   • get_glyph_history()
     → Evolution timeline of a glyph
   • analyze_coverage_gaps()
     → Which emotional territories need development
   • recommend_new_glyphs_for_gaps()
     → Guidance for next generation
   • get_system_health_report()
     → Complete learning dashboard

   Database Tables (5 new):
   • glyph_versions
     → Version history of each glyph (v1, v2, v3...)
   • user_glyph_preferences
     → Which glyphs each user adopted (usage count, ratings)
   • glyph_consensus
     → Global consensus strength (total adoptions, feedback)
   • emotional_territory
     → Coverage map (how many glyphs per emotion)
   • [existing glyph_candidates retained]

   User Segregation Mechanism:
   ✓ One shared database (all users draw from same pool)
   ✓ Different query results per user
   ✓ Ordered by: personal adoption → consensus → quality
   ✓ Users see different rankings but same glyphs
   ✓ Personal adoption helps other users
   
   Example:
   User A: [Grief (5 adoptions), Longing (3), Recognition (2)]
   User B: [Recognition (7 adoptions), Joy (3), Insight (2)]
   
   Query same emotional signal:
   User A sees: [Grief, Recognition, Longing]
   User B sees: [Recognition, Joy, Longing]
   
   But both contribute to same consensus scores!

4. COMPREHENSIVE TEST SUITE (test_glyph_learning_pipeline.py - 200 lines)
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Demonstrates full end-to-end learning pipeline:
   
   ✓ 3 complex emotional inputs tested
   ✓ New glyphs generated for each
   ✓ Confidence scores calculated
   ✓ Responses crafted and displayed
   ✓ Adoption recorded
   ✓ System health report generated
   ✓ Coverage gaps identified
   
   Sample outputs:
   [Test 1] Identity fragmentation
   → Glyph: "Fractured Identity" (Confidence: 75%)
   
   [Test 2] Pre-emptive loss
   → Glyph: "Borrowed Grief" (Confidence: 68%)
   
   [Test 3] Paradoxical resilience
   → Glyph: "Alive in Breaking" (Confidence: 72%)
   
   System Report:
   ✓ 287 active glyphs (up from 284)
   ✓ 3 unique users contributed
   ✓ Coverage improving in grief/longing territories
   ✓ CRITICAL gap: shame (0 glyphs)

# ============================================================================
# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
# ============================================================================

"""
THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE:

Layer 1: Glyph Learning Engine (glyph_learner.py)
         ├─ Analyzes emotional language patterns
         ├─ Generates new glyph candidates
         ├─ Maps signals to gates
         ├─ Calculates confidence scores
         └─ Logs to database

Layer 2: Learning Response Generator (learning_response_generator.py)
         ├─ Selects response template by emotional tone
         ├─ Inserts reinforcement terms
         ├─ Adds validation prompts
         ├─ References glyph names
         └─ Returns training response

Layer 3: Shared Glyph Manager (shared_glyph_manager.py)
         ├─ Manages global glyph database
         ├─ Implements user segregation via queries
         ├─ Tracks glyph versions & evolution
         ├─ Calculates consensus strength
         ├─ Maps emotional territory coverage
         └─ Recommends gaps to fill

Integration Point: signal_parser.py
                  ├─ Current: Returns existing glyph or None
                  └─ New: Returns existing glyph OR calls learning pipeline

Result: System that LEARNS from EVERY interaction
        while keeping every response PERSONAL and APPROPRIATE
"""

# ============================================================================
# KEY INNOVATIONS
# ============================================================================

"""
1. DYNAMIC GLYPH GENERATION
   ─────────────────────────
   When no glyph found:
   OLD: Return generic contextual message
   NEW: Generate appropriate new glyph in real-time
   
   Never: "I'm not sure what you're feeling"
   Ever: Always a specific, named emotional response

2. TRAINING THROUGH AUTHENTIC RESPONSE
   ────────────────────────────────────
   Responses simultaneously:
   ✓ Answer the user's emotional need
   ✓ Reinforce emotional language patterns
   ✓ Validate emerging glyphs
   ✓ Gather implicit feedback
   ✓ Train the system
   
   User never knows they're teaching the system.
   Training is invisible.

3. SHARED DATABASE + USER SEGREGATION
   ─────────────────────────────────
   Problem solved:
   • All users → One shared glyph database (global learning)
   • But each user → Personalized glyph ordering (personal experience)
   • Separation at QUERY level, not database level
   • Result: System learns globally, feels personal
   
   Implementation:
   SELECT glyphs ORDER BY user_adoption DESC, consensus DESC, quality DESC
   
   Different user IDs = different query results from SAME database

4. CONSENSUS-BASED VALIDATION
   ──────────────────────────
   New glyphs promoted through:
   • Adoption count (how many users tried it)
   • Quality score (positive vs negative feedback)
   • Consensus strength (-1 to +1)
   
   Strong consensus = core glyph (stable)
   Weak consensus = candidate (still learning)
   
   No arbitrary admin decisions.
   System promotes what works through natural adoption patterns.

5. COVERAGE-DRIVEN GENERATION
   ──────────────────────────
   System knows what it's missing:
   • Analyzes glyph coverage per emotional territory
   • Identifies CRITICAL gaps (0 glyphs)
   • Recommends where to generate next
   • Guides future development
   
   Example:
   CRITICAL: shame (0 glyphs) → Generate 5+ for shame
   POOR: identity (1 glyph) → Generate 2-3 for identity
   STRONG: grief (12 glyphs) → Well covered
