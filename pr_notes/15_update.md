Automated update for PR #15

I committed and pushed the latest fixes to `feat/response-engine`, and merged remote updates into the branch.

Conflict resolution details:
- Preferred local versions for: `demos/learning/detected_patterns.json`, `learning/detected_patterns.json`, `emotional_os/glyphs/glyphs.db`.

If you'd prefer the remote versions for any of these files, tell me which ones and I will restore them and push a follow-up commit.

I ran the focused integration test for clarification trace earlier; I'll run the full test suite next and will update this note with results.

(Automated note added by CI-style helper.)
