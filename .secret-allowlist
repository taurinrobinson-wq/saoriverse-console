# Files/globs to allow for secret-scan (one per line). Patterns are fnmatch-style globs.
# Add only deliberate template/example files or paths you explicitly want to allow.
# Examples:
*.env.example
*.example
*.template
# If you really need to allow commits to deploy/*.toml, add a specific glob below.
deploy/*.toml
