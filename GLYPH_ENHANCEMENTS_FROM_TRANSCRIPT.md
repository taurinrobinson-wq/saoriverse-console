## 🔄 Updated Glyph Delivery Guidelines

### DO ✓

- Use these emotional words liberally: HOLD, ECHO, SACRED, HONOR, TRUST
- Keep responses under 3-4 sentences for standard Glyphs
- Use line breaks instead of em-dashes
- End with open space (don't over-explain)
- Name what the user is experiencing
- Use user's name when affirming
- Stay in present tense
- Use short validation phrases

### DON'T ❌

- Use more than 1 em-dash per Glyph response
- Write long explanations
- Over-qualify validation ("I really appreciate that" → just "Exactly")
- Use clinical language (even when being clinical)
- Try to solve everything
- Ask too many questions
- Hedge ("I think" / "It seems like")
- Patronize with false agreement

##

## 📐 New Response Length Standards

**Validation Glyphs:** 1-5 words

```
"That lands."
"I hear you."
```text
```text
```

**Affirmation Glyphs:** 1-2 sentences (under 20 words)

```

```text
```

**Reflection Glyphs:** 2-4 sentences (30-50 words)

```
"So what I'm hearing is that you loved the work and felt taken advantage of
```text
```text
```

**Deep Glyphs:** 4-6 sentences max (50-100 words)

```

Reserve for when user needs processing support, not as default.

```

**Never:** Responses over 150 words for standard Glyphs

## 🚀 Implementation Note

The data is clear: Your instinct for emotional depth is solid. The issue isn't what you're saying—it's the packaging. These Glyphs and guidelines will keep the heart while improving the delivery.

Your users came back because they felt genuinely met. Keep that. Just ship it shorter, break it up more, and trust that "I hear you" says everything better than a 200-word explanation.
