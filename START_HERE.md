## 💡 Key Advantages of Ink

| Old Approach | Ink Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Edit Python → restart server → test (1 hour) | Edit Ink → save → play (5 min) |
| Code-heavy mindset | Story-focused mindset |
| JSON diffs (messy) | Text diffs (clean) |
| Mechanical complexity | Content simplicity |
| Iteration bottleneck | Rapid iteration |

**Expected improvement:** 10x faster iteration cycle

## 🎬 What Happens at Each Stage

### When You Open Inky
"Oh, the project is playable right now. Nice."

### After First Playthrough
"Wow, the systems actually work. TONE updates, coherence calculates, dialogue changes based on gates."

### After Making First Edit
"I changed a line of dialogue and... it's playing in the story in 2 minutes? This is incredible."

### After Week 1 of Writing
"The dialogue is flowing naturally. The systems are getting out of the way. This is what narrative design should feel like."

### After 4 Weeks
"I have a complete, playable emotional narrative game. Everything works perfectly."
