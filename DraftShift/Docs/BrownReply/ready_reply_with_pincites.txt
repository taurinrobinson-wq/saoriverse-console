Reply Section — Credibility and Record (Short, Judge‑Friendly)

- Introduction / Issue Presented: Plaintiffs’ opposition re‑frames the record by relying on Mr. Brown’s uncorroborated testimony. The SOD confirms the relevant reality: the court found Mr. Brown’s testimony of limited weight due to pervasive cognitive impairment and contradictions. 

- Court’s Core Credibility Findings: The court specifically rejected Pak’s and Plaintiffs’ versions where they relied on inconsistent witness statements:
  - On Pak’s credibility: (SOD citation not found)

- Controlling Record on Liability and Remedies:
  - Theft/Conversion & Norris: Plaintiffs did not establish that the Norris defendants took or retained plaintiffs' property. (SOD p.22:49).
  - Pak’s fiduciary breaches and elder‑abuse findings: (SOD citation not found)
  - Lease/balloon damages: are entitled to damages in the amount of $24,000 (SOD p.28:65).

- Narrow Relief; Why Plaintiffs’ Overbroad Theories Fail:
  - The SOD rejects broad theories of conversion, unfair‑competition, and treble damages against Norris because the court found consent/assent and insufficient proof: Plaintiffs failed to prove that Norris or Pak wrongfully obtained any clients or retained funds  (SOD p.29:44).

Closing sentence for filing slot (copy‑ready):
For the reasons stated and as reflected in the court’s Final Statement of Decision, Plaintiffs’ broad theories of theft and conversion are unsupported by the record and the court’s findings; the only sustainable claims are the narrow fiduciary/elder‑abuse breaches against Ms. Pak and the limited lease remedy awarded to Plaintiffs. We therefore respectfully request entry of judgment consistent with those findings and denial of any relief beyond what the SOD awarded.
