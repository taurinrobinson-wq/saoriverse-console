  "text": "D. Pak's Counter-Claims\nMichelle Pak seeks damages against Baird and Ann Brown and against Andrew and Jonathan\nWhite for damages she suffered as a result of an alleged assault and battery committed by the\nWhites during their entry into the law offices on October 21, 2023. The elements of a battery\nclaim are that the defendant touched plaintiff with the intent to harm or offend her; that the\nplaintiff did not consent; that the plaintiff did not consent to the touching, that plaintiff was\nharmed or offended by defendant s conduct, and that a reasonable person in plaintiffs situation\nwould have been offended by the touching. (CACI 1300.) Pak claims she suffered physical\ninjuries as well as severe emotional distress and seeks damages of $250,000, plus punitive\ndamages against each of the cross-defendants.\nIn weighing Pak's counter-claims, the court finds Pak to lack credibility as a witness. In\naddition to her constantly shifting and evasive testimony, Pak admitted that she had given false\ntestimony in her deposition about her pay arrangement with the Norris law firm. (RT 1/27/25 p.\n18:6-21.) She conceded she was not just paid$ I 00,000 a year or under $30 per hour, but\n\"multiple millions of dollars\" over her tenure with the Norris Law firm. (Id.) She testified\nfalsely that she had not made payments out of the Baird Brown Operating Expense Account in\n2021, 2020 and 2023, when the court easily found her signature on checks written on that\naccount for rent and other items. (RT 1/27/25, p. 58:1-28 and exhibits 7-15.) Indeed, the court\nfinds her testimony entirely untrustworthy.\nReviewing the evidence presented by plaintiff in support of her counter-claims, Pak testified\nthat she was given no advance notice that Brown would be coming to the office on October 21,\n2023. (2/10/25 RT at p. 11: 19-27.) She was called into the office that day, a Saturday, by\nmanagement for the building, who reported to her that people were in the office. She testified\nthat both Browns were present, as well as Jonathan and Andrew White, as well as a person who\nwas either a security guard or police. She was threatened multiple times that day by Andrew\nWhite that she would be arrested if she did not leave.\nThe key video here is Exhibit 15552, which is one of many showing a long standoff between\nPak and Andrew White, who was purportin g to terminate her as office manager for Baird Brown\nand requesting that she leave the office. Pak indicated that she wanted to be able to take her\nown checkbook, although she was unclear and evasive about what she wanted to take. The\n33\n\n===PAGE:34===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nI I\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 video, taken by Jonathan White, shows Pak squatting to unlock a file cabinet with Andrew White\nhovering over her and then pulling out a large check book. Andrew White demanded to see it\nand looked inside. When he noted that it belonged to Donald Norris, he snatched it from her and\nsaid she could not take it. He then roughly shut the drawer, pushing her back as he did so. In the\nprocess, Ms. Pak fell backward s a few inches onto her buttocks, and it appears that her hand was\nclipped by the drawer as it was shut. Andrew White did come in contact with Ms. Pak when he\npushed the drawer shut, though he did not strike or kick her. When Andrew White proceeded to\nwalk away, Pak leapt up and rushed after him. She can be seen pursuing him into the hall and\ngrabbing at him, at which point the video goes black. She claims that it was after the video was\nturned off that both of the Whites pushed her into a corner of the public hallway and hit her in\nthe head and kicked her with their feet and hit her in the chest, hands and face, \"continuously\"\nstriking her. (RT /10/25, atpp. 17:12-18:15.)\nPak testified that her hand was injured when both of the Browns grabbed her and tried to\ngrab her checkbook and twisted her hand and wrist when she was outside of the office. This\ntestimony is inconsistent with the video which shows that the checkbook was in Andrew\nBrown's hand when he exited the office. Pak would have had to wrestle it away from him for it\nto be in her hands. She also testified that her right hand was injured when it was slammed in the\ndrawer of the file cabinet and claims that Exhibit 15514 shows injuries of her right hand.\nAlthough it appears the door clipped her hand, (as she made a brief intake of breath), she\nimmediatel y used that same hand to grab a box, use her keys, push herself up from the floor and\ngrab at Mr. Brown in the hallway. None of her fingernails were damaged in this alleged injury\nto her hand. She also did not appear to suffer any injury to her legs while still in the office and\nwalked after Mr. Brown aggressively even after she fell back on the floor.\nShe testified that after the incident, she was so afraid she could not leave the house. This\ntestimony was impeached by photographs showing that she went back to the office -the site of\nthe incident-the next day. (RT 2/10/25, at p. 27:15-28:26; RT 2/14/25, p. 127:10-129:20 and\nExh. 1680.) Mrs. Brown, who was present in the offices on October 21, 2023, and who the\ncourt found to be an entirely credible witness, testified that she did not see or hear anything to\nindicate the Pak had been assaulted or injured that day. (RT 3/13/25, p. 176.)\nAs stated above, the court finds Pak not to be a credible witness. She admitted to perjuring\nherself at least once and much of her testimony was evasive, incredibl e, or outright false. The\ncourt finds CACI 5003 particularl y instructive here, which advises the trier of fact \"that if it\ndecides that a witness did not tell the truth about something important, the trier of fact may\nchoose not to believe anything that witness said. \" The court does not find credible her\ndescription of what happened in the hallway after the ·video went black. The court does not\nbelieve that the Whites beat and kicked her as she testified. The court finds this testimony\nexaggerated and false.\nThe court does agree that the video shows that Andrew White came in contact with Pak as he\npushed the drawer closed, but that such conduct was not intentional and was not intended to\nharm or offend her. With respect to the threats to call the police and have her arrested, because\nshe was still an employee of the Brown Law Firm, still owed a fiduciary duty to the firm, and\nAnn Brown and the Whites reasonably believed that Pak was engaging in financial misconduct,\nthe Whites were within their rights when they told Pak that she could be arrested if she did not\nleave the premises.\n34\n\n===PAGE:35===\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 Accordingly, the court finds in favor of Andrew White, Jonathan White, Baird Brown and\nAnn Brown on Pak's claims for assault and battery.\nAs for her remaining causes of action --1) Breach of Contract, 2) Money Had and Received,\n3) Open Book Account, 4) Account Stated, 5) Conversion, 6) Unauthorized Computer Access\n(violation of Penal Code §502), and 7) Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. --Pak\nfailed to establish all of the elements for any of these causes of action, entitling cross-defendants\nto judgment on these claims.\nE. Counter-Claims of Donald Norris and Donald Norris, a Law Corporation\nAs stated previously, in contrast to Pak, the court found Norris's testimony to be credible on\nmost points, even if evasive or overly cautious at times. The court did not find him to be\nexaggerating or downplaying negative facts. He satisfied the court that he was not aware of any\nmalfeasance of Pak towards Brown, that he reasonably trusted her representations about Brown'\ninvolvement and agreement with the transfer of clients, and that she was conducting the actual\ncommunicating with clients with Brown's consent and oversight. Perhaps he should have\nscrutinized every step of the process more carefully and obtained Brown's written consent to\neach step, but the court knows of no legal authority requiring that he do so. He justifiably relied\non representations made to him by Brown and by Brown's trusted office manager to accept that\nthese cases were being transferred to him to work up and complete, because Brown was\nwithdrawing from them as counsel because of his intent to retire.\n1. First Cause of Action -Conversion (Civ. Code§ 3336, CACI 2100)\nThe Norris cross-complainants contend that the cross-defendants unlawfully converted the\npersonal property of the Norris firm and its clients by seizing and retaining client files,\ncomputers, locked file cabinets, and critical law firm infrastructure, without notice, consent, or\nlegal process. This included physical hardware, digital data, and confidential documents\nbelonging solely to the Norris Law Firm. They contend they suffered substantial and\ndocumentable damages as a direct result of the unauthorized office takeover on October 21, 202\nand their inability to gain access to their files. Specifically, they claim that they lost the costs o\nleads they had paid for in the amount of $605,074.8, as well as $120,011.38 in documented\nexpenses they were required to incur to reestablish their practice after being forcibly removed\nfrom their prior office. (Ex. 15562; RT 3/7/25, Norris Direct, 160:3-166:15).\nCivil Code section 3336 states that \"[t]he detriment caused by the wrongful conversion of\npersonal property is presumed to be: [fl First-The value of the property at the time of the\nconversion, with the interest from that time, or, an amount sufficient to indemnify the party\ninjured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of the wrongful act\ncomplained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not have averted; and\n[1] Second-A fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the\nproperty. \"\nCross-complainant s established that on October 21, 2023, cross-defendants entered Suite 980\nat 3055 Wilshire Blvd. There was nothing unlawful about this entry. At the time, Brown was th\nlawful tenant and leaseholder, and he maintained employee s, including Pak, working on his\nremaining cases. The court agrees that Norris also had a right to be on the premises as a co-\n35\n\n===PAGE:36===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 tenant with the Brown Law Firm. While not formally approved by the landlord, the court finds\nthat the agreement between Brown and Norris was that Norris could also use the suite to conduct\nhis practice. (RT 2/28/25, p. 49-51.)\nOne of Norris's claims is that cross-defendants' actions on October 21, 2023 constituted a\n\"forced entry. \" Although this is not a separate cause of action, cross-defendants failed to\nestablish that the incidents on October 21, 2023 should be viewed as a \"forced entry. \" Brown\nand his agents had a lawful right to be on the premises, which were leased to Brown, bore his\nname on the outer doors as the only occupant, and for which he was paying some portion of the\nmonthly rent.\nThe undisputed evidence established that after entering the premises, cross-defendants took\npossession of everything in the suite, including certain files and other personal property\nbelonging to Norris and his law firm. According ly, the court finds that cross-complainants did\nestablish their claim that cross-defendants Baird Brown and Ann Brown collectively converted\ncertain of their personal property, in violation of Civil Code Section 3336. (See below for\ndiscussion of the liability of Andrew and Jonathan White for conversion.)\nNorris testified that the cost ofreplacing lost office furniture was $50,000. (RT 3/5/25 p.\n120: 1-50.) The court found this testimony not credible, given that all evidence points to Norris\nmerely moving into and occupying an existing office suite paid for and furnished by the Brown\nLaw offices. No credible evidence was presented that the furnishings and office equipment in\nthose buildings was paid for by anyone other than the Brown Law Offices. As stated\npreviously, the court discounts Pak's testimony in this regard, as she was a thoroughly unreliable\nwitness.\nHowever, Norris testified credibly that his firm had to expend time and effort to try to rebuil\nthe files, contact clients, and reestablish a new office. Norris testified that it took his firm three to\nfour months to reconstruct their files and get their new office up and running. His staff was\nworking full time on this project, with a total monthly payroll cost of $20,204. (RT 3/7 /25\npp.161-I 62.) Norris also explained that they had to incur additional costs to advertise their\nmove to the new suite of offices, or $8850. (Id., at pp. 163-165; and Exh. 15562.) These\ndamages are recoverab le, in the court's opinion, as money spent \"in pursuit\" of reconstructing\nthe personal property taken from them.\nThe court also found credible Norris's testimony that they had to purchase supplies, which\nmore likely than not, had been purchased by Pak and Norris over the prior three years and not by\nthe Brown Fim1, for an additional expense of $25,375, as well as computers, or $6241.75.910 The\n9 The court finds cross-defendants have not established that they are entitled to cost of parking,\ntelephone, insurance, or CCTV, since all of these costs would have been incurred in any event\neven if they had remained sharing the Brown Law suite of offices.\n10 An inordinate amount of time was spent at trial by Brown's attorneys trying to establish that\nseveral of the invoices presented for computers were falsified, including presentation of a\nforensic computer expert, Bruce Pixley. While the court found Pixley's testimony credible, it\ndid little to persuade the court that Pak or Norris had falsified the records or directed someone to\ndo that; the court finds it more likely that when Pak asked for back up invoices, the computer\n36\n\n===PAGE:37===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 court found this testimony credible and persuasive on the issue of damages caused by plaintiffs '\nseizure of their office supplies and computers. While Brown may have had the right to restrict\naccess to the suite, he excluded the Norris firm in a manner that was extremely disruptive to his\nlaw practice. Had the Brown firm simply requested Norris to leave within a reasonable time\nframe and to remove his office supplies, equipment and files, these expenses could have been\navoided.\nNorris did not establish that he was entitled to compensation for his office rental, as Norris\nwould always have had to pay at least $3000 for rent even if he had remained at the Brown suite\nof offices. Moreover, he did not present persuasive testimony that he had prepaid for the rent\nfor Suite 980 for the months of November, December and January, 2024, although he appears to\nbe claiming rent for those months as damages. The court is not persuaded that he even paid rent\nfor October 2023, given that the only evidence before the court of rent being paid by Norris was\n$15,000 at an earlier point in time. Pak also did not provide persuasive testimony that she\npersonally paid the rent for October 2023.\nWith respect to the central issue of the retention of client files, the court finds that cross­\ndefendants Baird and Ann Brown took possession of files which did not belong to them. The\ncourt further finds that Ann Brown made the decision to retain the files thereafter based on a\nmisconception that all of the files in the office which Brown had occupied for twenty years (and\nwhich bore his name and which was still occupied by his prior staff members), belonged to him.\n(RT 3/13/25, pp. 143-158.) Her belief was based on misinformation unintentionally supplied to\nher and to their counsel, the Whites, by Baird Brown, who was experiencing significant memory\nissues and cognitive decline due to Parkinsons disease and a significant Covid-19 illness. She\ndid admit, however, that she and her husband (with counsel), decided to withhold files, despite\nbeing told that at least some of the cases had never belonged to Baird Brown. Those files are\nnow in storage, paid for by Mrs. Brown and have not been returned because Mr. Norris would\nnot first provide a list of his clients by name so that they could determine true ownership of each\nof the sequestered files. This impasse has gone on for more than a year and half without\nresolution. (Id., at pp. 170-173.)\nAfter October 21, 2023, the parties entered into a written agreement by which the Brown\nLaw firm agreed to provide the Norris law firm with a computer and Norris agreed to provide the\nBrown law firm with a list of all clients Norris claimed to be his exclusive clients. (RT 2/28/24\nat pp. Exh.115-120; and Exh. 1694.) The agreement contained other tem1s about how the parties\ncould recover their claimed intellectual material and client files. While Norris signed the\nagreement, he later thought better of it and decided not to provide client names because of\nattorney client privilege concerns. (Id.) Norris admits that he was allowed back in the office on\nOctober 23, 2025, at which time he was \"probably\" given the ability to take all of his bank books\nand check books for his business accounts and for his client trust account. He was also allowed\nto identify all files that he wanted copied. However, Norris explained at trial that he was only\ngiven an hour or so, which was not enough time to go through all the files. (RT 2/28/25 at pp.\n120-125.) He also was very upset by the process, which allowed the Brown law firm to keep a\ncompany regenerated invoices working off old templates. Ultimately, plaintiffs failed to produce\ncredible evidence that Pak or Norris knowingly presented falsified invoices for the computers.\n37\n\n===PAGE:38===\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 copy of his client files -files to which he contends they had no right of access and should only\nhave been able to obtain with a court order. (Id.) Nonetheless, the court finds that at least some\nof the files he claims were not returned to him, in fact were returned to him only a few days after\nthe October 21, 2023 incident, including client files of clients he claims he could not contact,\nundermining his claim that he lost contact with all 200 clients. (RT 3/13/25 at pp. 52-63.)\nNorris testified that because of plaintiffs' takeover of their office and files, they lost 13 7\nclients from the Camp Lejeune litigation relating to toxic ground water -clients who they had\nobtained by paying a company for \"leads. \" All of these clients, Norris testified, had agreed to be\nrepresented by the Norris firm and had signed retainer agreements with the firm. (3/5/25 p. 120:\n18-130:18, and Exhs. 15526 and 15527.) They had paid $200,000 for leads to potential clients in\nthis case, from which they had obtained 500 clients, but lost contact with 137 after 10/31/23.\n(Id.) Norris testified that they had paid $50,000 for leads to clients in the Boy Scouts of America\ncases, $100,000 for clients in the \"firefighters' litigation, \" and $50,000 for hernia mesh leads,\nalthough Norris conceded he had not been able to quantity how many clients the lost from the\nhernia mesh litigation. (RT 3/5/25, pp.123:20-128:10.) He also did not quantify how many of\nthese clients were actually retained as a result of these leads, nor did he testify clearly about the\nsteps taken to connect with them. He explained that for cases in which work had commenced,\nthat work would be in the SugarSync system which they lost access to after October 21, 2023;\nfor other clients, their information would have been on computers, but not on the computers\ngiven back to them by the Whites. They did contact the lead firms from which they had\npurchased the client's names and information and were able to contact some clients by those\nmeans. Nonetheless, clients dropped them either because they were upset about the lack of\ncontact or because the Norris firm had lost their files on October 21, 2023; Norris claims there\nwere four boxes of client documents to which he was denied access, a point conceded by\nplaintiff Ann Brown. (RT 3/7/25, pp. 14-25, and Exh. 15525.)\nUltimately, Norris testified that he was able to identify 200 clients for which they had a\nretainer agreement or knew that they had been retained even if the retainer agreement could not\nbe found -all clients who later dropped the firm, he claims. (Id., at p. 25-29.) To quantify the\nfinancial loss suffered by his firm as a result of the loss of these clients, Norris simply multiplied\nthe number of lost clients times the amount paid per lead, for a total claimed loss of $605,074.)\n(Id., atp. 152:4-159:1 and Exh. 15561.)\nAlthough the evidence presented of the Browns withholding files and disrupting Norris's\nability to contact his clients is sufficient to establish a claim for conversion, the court finds\nNorris has not established actual damages.\nCross-complainants contend that they are not seeking speculative damages (for example, the\namounts they might have recovered had they been able to continue their representation of these\nclients uninterrupted), but only their out-of-pocket costs in paying for these leads in the first\ninstance. The court agrees that in principle, the out-of-pocket costs of paying for leads would be\ncompensable based on wrongful interference with Norris Law Corporation's business.\nNonetheless, the court finds that cross-complainants have not proven actual damages as a result\nof the wrongful retention of their files because cross-defendants have established that the Norris\ncross-complainants could have mitigated their damages but failed to do so. The court notes that\nCivil Code Section 3336 (Conversion) requires the plaintiff to establish the amount \"sufficient to\nindemnify the party injured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of\n38\n\n===PAGE:39===\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nIO\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 the wrongful act complained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not\nhave averted. \" Thus, Section 3336 incorporates the concept of mitigation into the affirmative\nburden of proof placed on the plaintiff.\nThe evidence established that Norris and the Whites were in contact immediately after Norris\nwas barred from the office and his files taken. orris and the Whites entered into an agreement\nby which Norris could have the files returned to him provided he indicated which files he needed\nreturned. (Exh. 1694.) Norris decided not to abide by this agreement because he claims he\nconcluded that it would violate the attorney-client privilege to provide client names. The court\nfinds this contention unavailing from a legal standpoint and also not credible based on the facts\npresented.\nOrdinarily the disclosure of a client's name by the attorney does not violate the attorney\nclient privilege. (See People ex rel Herrera v. Stender (2012) 212 Cal. App.4th 614, 648-650.)\nHad Norris provided the list as initially agreed, he would not be breaching the privilege with\nthose clients. Furthermore, the position he took actually interfered with his representation of\nthose clients, preventing him from continuing to represent their interests in a timely and effective\nmanner. Because he refused to provide a list of client names to plaintiffs, he had no access to\nthese clients' files and could not contact or represent them. Such conduct was unreasonable\nunder the circumstances and appears to this court to have been taken to maximize a claim for\ndamages rather than to protect his clients' best interests. Had Norris simply provided the names,\nobtained the original files and allowed Brown to keep a copy of the files (with an agreement that\nthey would not be reviewed), any damage to the clients would have been prevented, as we�l as\nany financial loss to the Norris firm. Under the circumstances, the court finds that this conduct\non the part of the Norris firm is a clear example of failure to mitigate damages. It is well­\nestablished that a \"plaintiff cannot be compensated for damages that were not incurred or could\nhave been mitigated by reasonable effort or expenditures. \" (Powerhouse Motorsports GrO'/i'P,\nInc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., USA (2013) 221 Cal. App.4th 884, citing Lu v. Grewal (2005) 130\nCal. App.4th 841, 849-850.) Further, as indicated elsewhere in the statement of decision, it was\nreasonable for the Brown defendants to initially take the files and to insist that they be able to\nretain a copy, not to review, but to ensure they were not later accused of destroying documents or\nfailing to return them, as happens unfortunately, with great frequency in disputes over retention\nof files.\nIn sum, the only credible evidence of damages presented by the Norris cross-complainants\nfor their claim of conversion relates to the cost of supplies, computers, advertising and staff time\nto reconstruct files, or a total of $60,670.75.\n2. Second Cause of Action (Violation of Penal Code§ 502, CACI 1812, 1814)\nThe Norris cross-complainants claim that cross-defendants intentionally and knowingly\naccessed and copied confidential digital files belonging to the Norris Law Firm without consent,\nin violation of Penal Code section 502.\nThe court finds that cross-complainants have established that cross-defendants intentionally\naccessed and copied confidential digital files belonging to the orris Law Firm without consent.\nIndeed, Jonathan White admitted that all computers were forensically imaged using Pixley\nForen ics at the Browns' direction, without any investigation into whether those computer� were\n39\n\n===PAGE:40===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 the property of the Norris firm (RT 3/14/25, J. White, cross, 32:2-34:28; 55: 1-63:4). Mr. Norris\nobjected in time and advised the parties that his active client files were stored on those systems\n(Ex. 15558). Even if some of the data had once belonged to the Brown Law Firm, some of the\ndata certainly belonged exclusively to the Norris Law Firm.\nPenal Code Section 502 provides: \"In addition to any other civil remedy available, the owner\nor lessee of the computer, computer system, computer network, computer program, or data who\nsuffers damage or loss by reason of a violation of any of the provision s of subdivision ( c) may\nbring a civil action against the violator for compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other\nequitable relief. Compensatory damages shall include any expenditure reasonably and\nnecessarily incurred by the owner or lessee to verify that a computer system, computer network,\ncomputer program, or data was or was not altered, damaged, or deleted by the access.\nThe court finds that the contents of the four storage files maintained by Ann Brown must be\nimmediately returned to Norris, as well as all of the computers in the office at the time of the\ntake over. With respect to the issue of damages, the court finds that the loss described above is\nalso recoverable under Section 502, specifically, the cost of staff to attempt to restore the files,\nthe costs of the computers, or a total of $26,445.75. These expenses can only be recovered once.\nThe remainder of the damages established for conversion are unrelated to unlawful access to the\ncomputers and so are not recoverable under Section 502. The claimed damages related to the\nlost leads are not recoverable for the reasons stated above.\n3. Liability of Andrew and Jonathan White for Conversion and Violation of Pena\nCode Section 502\nCross-defendants Jonathan and Andrew White contend that they cannot be liable to cross­\ncomplainants for damages caused by their clients' entry into the office and retention of case files.\nThe court agrees that that their conduct was committed in good faith, based on a genuine, albeit\nmistaken belief, that Baird Brown's office and case files had been commandeered by Donald\nNorris and Michele Pak, without Brown's knowledge of consent. Under the agency immunity\ndoctrine, the Whites cannot be liable \"to third persons for acts committed in good faith in\nperformance of professional activities as an attorney for his client. \" (Roberts v. Ball, Hunt, Harl,\nBrown & Baerwitz (1976) 57 Cal. App.3d 104, 109.) Norris and Pak did not establish that the\nWhites' conduct was \"actuated by malicious motives, \" or that they \"shared in the illegal motives\nof [their] clients. \" (Id., at p. 109.) On the contrary, at all times the Whites were acting solely as\nattorneys on behalf of their client, who they reasonably believed had been deceived. The court\nalso agrees with cross-defendant s that Norris and Pak did not establish any of the exceptions to\nthis agency immunity doctrine: there was no or insufficient evidence that the Whites engaged in\nany fraud, or that they conspired with the Browns, or that they received any financial gain\nbecause of their activities. At most, Pak and Norris established that the Whites, at some point,\ndiscovered or reasonably should have discovered that some of the files they had sequestered\nprobably belonged solely to the Norris law firm. But their conduct in requesting that Norris\nprovide them a I ist of clients whose files needed to be returned was not unreasonable and 'Yas\ntaken to protect the Browns from claims that they had not returned Norris's client files. Thus,\nthe Brown's failure to return cases files was done solely to protect the client and not for the\npersonal benefit of the attorneys. Accordingly, judgment should be entered in favor of the\nWhite defendants on the cross-complaint.\n40\n\n===PAGE:41===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 4. Damages pursuant to Penal Code Section 496(c).\nCross-comp lainants also seek treble damages pursuant to Penal Code Section 496(c),\nwhich provides that \"[e]very person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or\nthat has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be\nso stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or\nwithholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, \" is\nsubject to incarceration. Subdivision (c) states that any person who has been injured by a\nviolation of section 496(a) \"may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if\nany, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees. \"\nWhile the language is broad, the Supreme Court has clarified that treble damages and\nattorney fees are only available in cases which constitute criminal theft. (Siry Investment, L. P. v.\nFarkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333, 361.) The court explained, \"not all commercial or\nconsumer disputes alleging that a defendant obtained money or property through fraud,\nmisrepresentation, or breach of a contractual promise will amount to a theft. To prove theft, a\nplaintiff must establish criminal intent on the part of the defendant beyond \"mere proof of\nnonperformance or actual falsity. \" (People v. Ashley (1954) 42 Cal.2d 246,264,267 P.2d 271.).... If misrepresentations or unfulfilled promises \"are made innocently or inadvertently, they can\nno more form the basis for a prosecution for obtaining property by false pretenses than can an\ninnocent breach of contract. \" (Id., at p. 264,267 P.2d 271.) \" (Siry at p. 361.) In Siry, the record\napproved an award of treble damages because the evidence was \"consistent with a conclusion\nthat defendants acted not innocently or inadvertently, but with careful planning and deliberation\nreflecting the requisite criminal intent. \" (Id.)\nIn the instant case, cross-complainants have not established anything approaching\ncriminal intent on the part of the Browns ( or the Whites). In the court's opinion, Baird Brown di\nnot appear to have the mental faculties to possess criminal intent; he persuaded the court that he\ntruly believes that all of the cases are his and that he was betrayed by Pak and Norris. His wife\nand his attorneys reasonably believed in the summer and fall of 2023 that Baird Brown had been\nthe victim of fraud and elder abuse by his trusted office manager and Norris. They did not know\nand could not know the communications which had occurred between Norris and Brown in 2019\nas Brown had hidden that information from his wife due to his embarrassment that he was giving\nup the practice of law and facing a year long suspension. Thus, their conduct in seizing the\ncomputers and files was not unreasonable on October 21, 2023. Thereafter, the parties took lega\npositions as to whether the files should be returned en masse and uncopied or whether the White\nand Ms. Brown had to retain a copy to protect themselves from being accused of destroying files\nBased on this stalemate between the various attorneys involved, the files remained locked up in\nstorage shed and this litigation unfolded. This sad situation is many things, but it is not crirnina\ntheft. According ly, cross-complainants request for treble damages and attorney fees is denied.\n4. Punitive Damages\nCross-complainants failed to establish that cross-defendants acted with malice, fraud or\noppression. Although the court finds that the Browns and their counsel should not have\nwithheld files from Norris, the court finds that the decisions which led up to their entry into the\noffice and retention of files were based on misinformation supplied by Baird Brown due to his\nown failing memory and cognitive function. The court finds that by the fall of 2023, Brown had\nforgotten that he had transferred many of his cases to Norris, that he had blessed Pak's work wit\n41\n\n===PAGE:42===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 Norris, that Norris had been given permission to use his office and share his staff, and that Pak\nwas no longer working for him, except to complete closing out some personal injury cases. He\nconveyed this information to his wife and to his counsel, leading them to take aggressive steps to\nreclaim the office and files, which they quite reasonably believed belonged to the Brown Law\nOffices. Their subsequent conduct is explainable by the misinformation provided to them by a\nclient experiencing serious mental decline. Their conduct under these circumstances cannot be\nconstrued as malicious, fraudulent or oppressive -merely gravely mistaken.\nORDERS ON THE FINAL STATEMENT OF DECISION\nThe Clerk of the Court is directed to file thjs Statement and cause copies to be served by\nmail upon the parties' counsel.

RULING ON OBJECTIONS SUBMITTED BY CROSS-DEFENDANTS\nANDREW M. WHITE AND JONATHAN N. WHITE\nCross-Defendant s Andrew and Jonathan White's objection to the Statement of Decision's\nfinding that they are jointly and severally liable for acts of conversion committed by the Browns\nis granted. The court agrees that their conduct was committed in good faith, based on a genuine,\nalbeit mistaken belief, that Baird Brown's office and case files had been commandeered by\nDonald Norris and Michele Pak, without Brown's knowledge or consent. Under the agency\nimmunity doctrine, the Whites cannot be liable \"to third persons for acts committed in good faith\nin performance of professional activities as an attorney for his client. \" (Roberts v. Ball, Hunt,\nHart, Brown & Baerwitz (1976) 57 Cal. App.3d l 04, 109.) Norris and Pak did not establish that\nthe Whites' conduct was \"actuated by malicious motives, \" or that they \"shared in the illegal\nmotives of [their] clients. \" (Id., at p. 109.) On the contrary, at all times the Whites were acting\nsolely as attorneys on behalf of their client, who they reasonably believed had been deceived.\nThe court also agrees with cross-defendants that Norris and Pak did not establish any of the\nexceptions to the agency immunity doctrine: there was no or insufficient evidence that the\nWhites engaged in any fraud, or that they conspired with the Browns, or that they received any\nfinancial gain because of their activities. At most, Pak and Norris established that the Whites, at\nsome point, discovered or reasonably should have discovered that some of the files they had\nsequestered probably belonged solely to the Norris law firm. But their conduct in requesting that\nNorris provide them a list of clients whose files needed to be returned was not unreasonable (see\nbelow) and was taken to protect the Browns from claims that they had not returned Norris 's\nclient files. Thus, the Whites' failure to return cases files was done solely to protect their client\nand not for the personal benefit of the attorneys. The statement of decision has been corrected\nto remove any finding of liability against Andrew and Jonathan White."
