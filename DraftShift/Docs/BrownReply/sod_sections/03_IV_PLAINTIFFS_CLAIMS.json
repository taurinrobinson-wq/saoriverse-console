  "text": "IV. PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS\nA. Claims Against Taurin Robinson\nThere is no evidentiary basis for holding Robinson liable under any theory advanced\nin the complaint. The record is devoid of any proof that Robinson engaged in fraud,\nmisconduct or breached any fiduciary duty. At the time of the relevant events, Robinson\nwas a law student and junior employee who acted solely under the direction of Brown,\nNorris and Pak. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 88:13-89:4.) He had no decision-making\nauthority, no control over client funds or firm assets, and received no financial benefit from the\nalleged conduct. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 93:27-95:1.) Robinson never received any\n8 Notably, the suite of offices still only said \"Law Offices of Baird Brown\" as of October 21,\n2023. (3/13/25, pp. 119, 21-28.) The Norris Law Firm was never identified on the suite's outer\ndoors.\n19\n\n===PAGE:20===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 settlement funds or other compens ation despite his salary. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 93:27-\n95: l.) Brown testified that only he and Pak had access to the firm's bank accounts. (RT\n1/28/25, Brown, cross, 18:9-19:2.)\nWhen initially asked what Robinson did wrong, Brown responded that Robinson\nhad facilitated transfers of money from the Brown Law bank accounts. (RT 1/28/25, Brown,\ncross, 27:5-10.) However, when confronted with his earlier testimony that only he and Pak\nhad account access, Brown conceded, \"[t]hat's a fair point. Maybe he didn't. \" (RT 1/28/25,\nBrown, cross, 27: 11-28:4.) When asked whether Robinson did anything else wrong, Brown\nadmitted, \"[n]othing else comes to mind. \" (RT 1/28/25, Brown, cross, 28:5-7.)\nB. Claims Against Donald G. Norris and Donald G. Norris, A Law Corporation\nThe court prefaces its findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the claims\nbrought against Norris and his law corporation with the critical finding that Brown practiced\nalone prior to his suspension and thereafter. Brown never had a partner, associate, or \"of\ncounsel\" attorney associated with his firm to assist him with the practice of law. (RT 1/23/25 at\np. 34:2-14.) He admitted that when he was sick with Covid for an extended period in 2022, there\nwas no attorney handling any of his cases to his knowledge and he was not bringing in any new\ncases. His wife confirmed this. When asked how he was paying his staff, he stated that he did\nnot recall. (Id., at p. 34: 15-36: 16.) He did have various paralegals working for him, all non­\nattomeys, and an office manager, defendant Michelle Pak, who was actively engaged in helping\nhim attract clients and run his law practice. Neither Pak nor the various legal assistants could\nlegally practice law or handle legal matters without Brown's active participation and supervision.\nThus, for the three months that he was suspended, no work could take place on any of these cases\nwithout some lawyer other than Brown being responsible for the work. According to Brown, he\ndid not arrange to hire an attorney or associate in an attorney to handle the work during his\nsuspension; he simply sent notices to clients to let them know there were two attorneys they\ncould call if they had a concern: Norris and another contract attorney named Davis.\nIn addition, Brown and his counsel provided no explanation as to what lawyer was handling\nhis practice when he had back surgery and a long recovery at the end of 2019 and early 2020;\nwho handled it during his suspension in 2020 and who handled it when he was on a ventilator,\nhospitalized or in rehab through much of 2022. Either Brown agreed to have Norris take over\nthe practice, as Norris testified, or Brown was planning to have non-lawyers run his practice,\nwhich would be illegal. The court finds it more likely than not that Brown accepted that he\nneeded to transfer his cases to another attorney, here Norris, due to his declining health. Further,\nthe court finds it more likely than not that due to his many health issues and cognitive decline,\nwhen he looked back into the affairs of his office in 2023 (after nearly three years of inaction on\nhis part), he had forgotten that he had agreed to the transfer. The court believes that in 2023 and\nthereafter he was truly bewildered about what had transpired. Having not shared any of this\ninformation with his wife, she justifiabl y was concerned that Pak and Norris had colluded to\npush her husband out.\nIndeed, Brown admitted that after his suspension concluded at the end of June 2020,\nwhatever work he did on his cases thereafter was \"fairly minor. \" (RT 1/23/25 p. 46:24-28.) He\ncould not recall at the time of trial any work he had done on any case, or whether he had even\ngone to court on a case. (Id., at p. 47:1-28.) Notably, no evidence was presented by plaintiffs'\n20\n\n===PAGE:21===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 team to show that he had in fact performed legal work on a single case after his suspension on\nApril 1, 2020. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 54:21-62:10.)\nAlso very telling is Brown's agreement with Norris on the Androgel case. The parties\nsigned a written agreement, which Brown did not dispute, giving Norris 20% of the fees to be\nrecovered on these cases. Not only does this completely bely Brown's claim that he had no\nmeetings or agreement with Norris in the 2019 period, but it also supports defendants ' contention\nthat Brown understood he needed help and needed to transfer his cases to a new lawyer; why\nwould a healthy active attorney who had performed considerable work on lucrative mass tort\nlitigation give 20% of the future recovery to an attorney he did not know, who would do nothing\non the case?\nBrown admitted that he did represent Norris in a legal malpractice case brought against I\nBrown and Norris relating to a case referred to as the \"Mick case. \" (RT 1/22/25 p. 128:6-132:\n4.) He admitted to filing an answer on behalf of himself and Norris in December 2020. (1/27/25\nam, p. 72:6 -76:2, and Exh. 15534.) He claims that Norris was unhelpful in providing him with\ninformation and that he had no idea Norris had any involvement in the Mick litigation. (Id.) The\ncourt finds this hard to believe given that Brown admitted that he undertook to represent both of\nthem when the Mick family filed suit against them for missing the statute of limitation s. The\ncourt questions why Brown would represent Norris unless he thought Norris was working on the\ncase either as his associate or co-counsel. Brown never explained why he would represent Norris\nif he had no relationship with Norris or knowledge that Norris had assumed responsibility for\nany of his cases.\nBrown also admitted on cross-examination that in the 2020 period, he received emails from\nthe Law Offices of Don Norris, attaching draft notices of letters to send to clients. One of those\nletters informed clients that Brown had been suspended from practice; the other advised that\nBrown would be \"stepping away from [the] case\" and advising them that Norris would be\ncontacting them to discuss transfer of the case to Norris. (Exh. 15505.) Even though these were\nnot the ultimate notices sent to clients, they do show that Norris and Brown were in email\ndiscussion s about how best to inform clients of Brown's suspension and to transition the work to\nNorris. (RT 1/23/25 p. 43:3 -45:23.) Brown did not deny that he had received these emails. In\naddition, the court received into evidence text messages between Pak and Brown from the June\n2020 period where they discussed transferring cases to and from the Norris office. (RT 1/28/25\np. 31:2-38:6 and Exh. 1573, pp. 6-8.)\nBrown admitted that he continued to have access to his bank accounts (business and client\ntrust accounts) in 2019 and 2020. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 51: 2-24.) When shown his business bank\naccount statements for 2020 and 202 I, which showed a precipitou s reduction in revenue, he\nconceded that he had access to these accounts but does not recall there being a reduction of\nincome. (RT 1/28/25 at pp. 18:5 -22:8.) The court concludes from these records that either\nBrown did not bother to look at them because he was utterly disengaged from his practice, or he\nlooked at them and was not bothered by what he saw, because he knew that his law practice had\nbeen effectively transferred to Norris, thereby necessarily reducing his income.\nIndeed, had Brown been actively engaged in any of his federal mass tort cases, he would\nhave seen that substitutions of counsel had been filed in each of them, replacing his name as\ncounsel of record with that of Donald Norris. The execution of substitutions of attorney further\n21\n\n===PAGE:22===\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 confirms that Norris assumed representation of Brown's former clients with no objection raised.\n(Def. Exs. 15555, 1692; Pl. Exs. 1653-1655.) Again, either Brown knew and consented to these\nsubstitutions or he was not monitoring his federal practice for over three years. The court finds\nit is more lik~ly than not that he consented to these substitutions; not that he engaged in\ndeliberate malpractice or unethical conduct.\nFinally, the email exchange between Brown and Pak in June 2023, the questions posed by\nBrown to Granillo in June 2023, and the series of text messages spanning March 26, 2020 to\nJune 2023 (Exh. 1573) strongly support the court's conclusion that Brown was not doing\nanything to actively supervise and manage his cases after he was first suspended on April 1,\n2020, but rather understood that the law practice was being run by Norris. (RT 3/4/25, pp. 49-\n50.) That Brown had no idea what the status of his various cases was in June 2023 means he had\nnot been supervising them or moving them forward. Had he attempted to take any action on\nbehalf of any of his cases in the period between April 1, 2020 and June 2023, he would have\nrealized that he had been substituted out in early 2020 and that another attorney, Donald Norris,\nhad been handling many of these matters.\nJ. Claim for Theft and Conversion Against Norris and Norris Law Corporation -(Cal.\nPenal Code§ 496(c))\nConversion requires that Plaintiffs prove ownership or a right to possess specific\nproperty, that Defendant s substantially interfered with that property through unauthorized\nconduct, and that Plaintiffs were harmed as a result. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General\nCorp. (2007) 148 Cal. App.4th 97.)\nPlaintiffs did not establish that the Norris defendant s took or retained plaintiffs' property.\nPlaintiffs failed to prove that Norris wrongfully obtained any clients or retained funds received in\nsettlement for those clients which rightfully belonged to plaintiffs. The court finds that Brown\nvoluntarily transferred the contested cases to Norris, commencing in 2019, because of his desire\nto wind down his practice and withdraw from the active practice of law given his significant\nhealth issues, and later, his suspension by the state bar. While Brown's cognitive function was\nprofoundly impaired at trial (and was significantly impaired as early as January 2022 when he\nnearly died from Covid), all witnesses agreed that Brown was functioning well enough in 2019\nand 2020 to understand that he was voluntarily transferring his cases to Norris, to cooperate in\nthat process, and to negotiate many aspects of it. Anyone dealing with him during that process,\nincluding but not limited to Pak and Norris, would reasonably have believed that he had full\ncapacity to make the decision to wind down his practice and transfer his cases. The court\nconcludes that any deceptive practices which were instituted -and there were misstatements\nmade to clients to grease the wheels of moving clients to a new law firm -were conceived and\nexecuted by Pak. The court finds that Norris had no knowledge of the communication s being\nsent to clients and did not conspire or assist Pak or the other legal assistants at the firm to send\nany of those misleading communications. While the court disapproves of the wording of the\ncommunicati ons, that conduct does not constitute theft or conversion, since the evidence\noverwhelmingly supports the finding that Brown agreed to transfer these cases to Norris. If the\nmeans used were deceptive in any way, that does not transform the transfer itself into actionable\ntheft or conversion. The deceived parties, if any, were the clients, not Baird Brown.\nIn their closing brief, plaintiffs did not advance any argument that the Norris defendant s\n22\n\n===PAGE:23===\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 had taken or converted personal property in the sujte of offices out of which Norris and Pak\nworked. In any event, there was no specific evidence presented as to any particular items of\npersonal property which were converted; thus, any such claim would fail as well.\n2. Jnterferellce with contractual relations between Brown Law Firm and its clients.\nFor the same reasons discussed above, the court finds that plaintiffs have failed to\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant s wrongfully interfered with the\nagreements between the Brown Law Firm and its clients. Baird Brown voluntarily decided to\nwithdraw from representation on the cases at issue here, to substitute the Norris Firm as counsel\non those cases and to transfer any cases which were just at their outset to the new firm. Thus,\nthere could be no interference with relations, since Baird Brown himself had decided to\nterminate those relationships.\n3. Unfair Business Practices\nPlaintiffs contend that defendant s engaged in unfair competition, both at common law\nand in violation of Business & Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq., by 1) Using fraud and deceit\nto steal Brown Law clients; 2) Appropriating the services of staff personnel on Brown Law's\npayroll; 3) Appropriating use of Brown Law's exclusive offices, Suite 980; 4) Using\nBrownLaw 's address and phone number for the Norris/Pak Firm; 5) Incorporating a headshot\nand the professional background of Brown into the new website for the Norris/Pak Firm\n(dnorrislaw. com); and 6) Passing off Norris as being closely associated with Brown Law.\nAs stated above, there was insufficient evidence presented to support a claim for unfair\ncompetition based on alleged theft of Brown Law clients. The court also finds that there was\ninsufficient evidence that the Norris firm appropriated the services of staff personnel, used the\nBrown law office suite, or used the Brown Law Firm address and phone number. The court finds\nthat Brown gave permission to Pak and Norris to use his staff, office suite, and office phone, at\nthe same time that Brown required Pak to use the suite and staff to finish up his remaining cases.\nBrown had access to the financial books, the office, the case files (through SugarSync), and the\ncourt records (through Pacer and other means), which would have clearly revealed to him that\nwork was being done out of the suite by Norris and Pak, starting as early as his suspension in\nApril 2020. The court concludes that Brown accepted this arrangement. To the extent that\nBrown believes and now claims that office expenses, staff time, and rent should have been paid\nby the Norris office, either in whole or in some shared manner, no evidence was presented by\nplaintiffs to quantify any costs (payroll, rent or otherwise) that they paid, which should have\nbeen paid by the Norris firm, at least through October 21, 2023 There was no evidence that\nBrown continued to put any money into the firm after April 2020. Pak testified that she did put\nmoney into the business account or otherwise paid office expenses herself. Given this record,\nthe court finds plaintiffs have failed to establish unfair competition as a result of Norris and\nPak's use of the staff and the physical office, address and phone number through October 21,\n2023.\nHowever, plaintiffs did establish that Pak negotiated a reduction in the lease which\nincluded a balloon payment, which Brown has been left to pay, despite the fact that Pak and\nNorris benefited from the reduction in rent through the end of October 2023. As discussed\nfurther below, the court finds that plaintiffs have established that Pak breached her fiduciary du\n23\n\n===PAGE:24===\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 to Brown by negotiating a balloon payment, using the office suite for her? ew business wi~h\nNorris and not paying her share of the balloon payment. There was no evidence that Norns\nparticipated in this breach or was even aware of it.\nWith respect to the claim that Norris violated Business & Professions Code Section\n17200 by using Brown's likeness on Norris's website, the court finds that the evidence is unclear\nwhether Brown's photo and bio was visible to the public and, if so, for how long. The court\nfinds credible Norris's testimony that he did not direct that Brown's image be used. The only\nevidence of Brown's image being visible to the public shows what appears to be a website under\nconstruction. Assuming, arguendo, that it was visible to people accessing Norris's website for\nsome uncertain period of time, the court finds that no damage has been established, nor can be\npresumed. Under the circumstances, plaintiffs have failed to prove that the website photo and bio\nconstitutes an unfair business practice.\nFinally, the court does find that it was deceptive advertising to describe Norris as an\nassociate of the law firm or his firm as a division of the Brown law firm in letters sent to the\nclients. The description might have misled clients to believe there was a long-standing\nrelationship between the two firms or attorneys, that Norris was in fact covered by Brown's\nmalpractice insurance, or that the two firms were one and the same. These letters should have\nbeen drafted in a way that did not create a false impression of a prior or existing relationship\nbetween the two firms. But these communications, while deceptive, did not cause any damage\nto the Brown law firm or deprive it of any money which could be restored, given that the court\nfinds that Brown approved the transfer of all of these cases to Norris. Further, the court finds\nthat Brown was actively running his office in 2019 and early 2020 and had full access to these\nletters that were being sent to clients. Thus, he would have approved these mailings, even if he\nno longer remembers that he did so. Plaintiffs have failed to establish any basis for recovery\nunder Section 17200."
