INTROD UCTION \nIn this document the Court announces its Final Statement of Decision. The bench trial came \non regularly for trial 'on January 22, 2025, in Department 45 of the Los Angel_es ~uperior _Court, \nCentral District, Judge Virginia Keeny presiding , and continued thereafter , with mterruptions, for \nseventeen days of testimony , concluding on March 14, 2025. Plaintiffs Baird Brown, Baird \nBrown, a Law Corporation, and Ann Brown were represented by Andrew M. White and \nJonathan N. White. Defendants and cross-complainants Donald G. Norris and Donald G. Norris, \na Law Corporation, were represented by David Welch of Enso Law, LLP. Defendant and cross­\ncomplainant Michele Pak was represented by Brett A. Greenfield . After the parties rested on \nMarch 14, 2025, the court requested closing briefs to be submitted on May 14, 2025, at which \ntime the matter was taken under submission. The court issued a Tentative Statement of \nDecision on June 30, 2025. Cross-defendants Andrew and Jonathan White submitted objections \nto the tentative statement of decision on July 25, 2025. Plaintiffs submitted objections on July \n29, 2025, and the Norris Defendants /Cross-comp lainants filed objections on July 30. The court \nrequested additional briefing from Pak on the objections raised by plaintiffs. \nHaving now considered the post-trial briefs, all admissible evidence and argument of counsel \nat trial, as well as the objections of the parties, the court now issues this Final Statement of \nDecision . \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiffs filed the initial complaint in this action on November 8, 2023, seeking damages, \npenalties, punitive damages and attorney fees against defendant s for allegedly stealing plaintiffs ' \nmass tort law practice and diverting money and clients to their coffers. Plaintiffs' operative First \nAmended Complaint was filed on August 22, 2024 and sets forth seven causes of action: (1) \nElder and Financial Abuse; 2) Theft and Conversion under Penal Code Section 496(c); (3) Unfair \nCompetition under Bus. & Prof. Code Section 17200 et seq.; (4) Interference with Contract; (5) \nBreach of Fiduciary Duty; (6) Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty and (7) \nConspiracy. \nDonald Norris filed a cross-comp laint against Baird and Ann Brown, Baird Brown, a law \ncorporation, and Jonathan and Andrew White on January 12, 2024, seeking damages for \n(1) Conversion ; (2) Violation of Cal. Penal Code§ 502; (3) Unfair Practices Act (Cal. Bus. & \nProf. Code§ 17200 et seq.); (4) Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage ; and (5) \nBreach of Fiduciary Duty. \nMichelle Pak filed a cross-comp laint against the same cross-defendants on February 5, 2024, \nalleging various causes of action. By the time of trial, the only causes of action pursued by Pak \nwere claims for Assault and Battery, for which she sought $250,000 against each of the Brown \ndefendant s and each of the White defendant s, plus punitive damages. \nIII. EVIDENCE PRESENTED \nTestimony of Baird Brown \nBaird Brown developed a successfu l plaintiff's personal injury law practice, specializing in \nmass tort litigation. Prior to 2019, he began to display symptoms of Parkinson's disease and in \n2 "}, {"page": 3, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nl l \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 June 2019 was formally diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. (RT 3/5/25 p. 160:3-13.) In \nDecember 2019 and January 2020, Brown was frequently absent from the Brown Law offices \ndue to extreme back pain which necessitated spinal surgery in December 2019, followed by \nrecovery and recuperation well into 2020. (Id., 161 :6 -162: 12.) The Covid-19 lockdown \nrequired Brown to reduce his exposure to the pandemic by working from his home office, \nstarting in March 2020 and continuing until at least March 2023. (Id., 162:24-163:23.) Brown \nsuffered a near-fatal infection of Covid-19 in January 2022, causing complete respiratory failure \nwhich required a ventilator to breathe for him in the Torrance Hospital ICU. (Id., p.164: 10-\n166: 16.) In-patient and out-patient treatment s following this serious illness extended into mid-\n2022. (Id., 166: 17-26.) \nIn addition to these health issues, after a lengthy investigation by the California Bar \nAssociation , Brown was formally suspended by the California Supreme Court, effective April 1, \n2020, for a period of three months, pursuant to disciplinary proceeding s. (Def. Ex. 15503.) He \nhad been facing a one-year suspension. In compliance with Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule \n9.20, he submitted a signed declaration under penalty of perjury affirming that he notified all \nclients and urged them to seek alternative counsel (Def. Ex. 15508; RT 1/27/25, Brown Cross, \n48: 1-50:24.) He acknowledged in his own testimony that he signed this declaration , which was \nexecuted on May 7, 2020. (RT 1/27/25, p. 49:24-51 :6.) \nDuring the Covid \"lockdown ,\" plaintiff worked at home but communicated regularly, he \nclaims, with Pak and staff in his office. (l/23/25 at 25, ln. 9 to 19.) After the lockdown , he \nadmitted that he stopped going into the office, except occasiona lly on weekends. (RT 1 /23/25 at \np. 25:20 -27.) \nPlaintiffs contend that despite these health crises and his suspension, Brown had no intention \nto retire and continued to maintain his practice and go into work on weekend s to review matters \nuntil June 2023, when he first had suspicions that Michelle Pak, his office manager, was no \nlonger working for him and that something was amiss with his cases. (RT 1/22/25 p. 119: 19 -\n122: 28.) It was only upon further inquiry after that date that Brown claims he learned for the \nfirst time that his cases had been transferred to another law firm, the law offices of Donald G. \nNorris, and that his office manager , defendant Pak, was no longer working for him, but for \nNorris. Norris and Pak contend that Brown transferred his mass tort practice to Norris when \nBrown realized that his declining health and the suspension made it impossible to continue to \npractice law and that Brown participated in and consented to the transfer. \nPlaintiff s cognitive decline was on display at trial. While he could understand questions \nand speak clearly and eloquently at times, he appeared to have little memory of past events and \nbecame easily confused and exhausted on the witness stand. He had little to no recollection of \nwhat had occurred with his firm or his cases and clients for the entire relevant time period (2019 \nto 2023). Indeed, at times he contradicted his attorney and wife's theory of the case by stating \nthat he knew Norris would take responsibility for all of his cases. (RT 1/27 /25 am, p. 26: 18-21.) \nThe court received testimony from Dr. Matthew Lombard, Brown's treating physician for the; \npast four or five years, who testified that Brown suffers from Parkinson's disease and some \nmemory issues associated with it but has not been diagnosed with dementia. (RT 1/22/25, 84:9-\n85:9; 88: 10-11.) Or. Lombard conceded that Brown could suffer from dementia even though he \nhas no formal diagnosis, and that if it reached an advanced stage, he could forget meeting \n3 "}, {"page": 4, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 individua ls in the past. (Id., at 89: 1-89:25.) However , Dr. Lombard believe~ if he had de1:1entia , \nit was only in an early stage. (Id., at 90:6-12.) Dr. Lombard, however , admitted that he himself \nhad no memory of his patient's health situation in the critical time period, 2019 to 2_020, and. \ntestified that he saw him only rarely. Or. Lombard' s testimony was further undermined by his \nutter lack of familiarity with his own patient's chart: for example, he indicated that Brown had \nhad no significant health history, apparently not knowing about the many months in critical care, \nthe lengthy hospitalization and extended rehab due to Covid in 2022, including extended time on \na respirator, as well as plaintiff s multiple back surgeries. (Id., at p. 87: 16-88:28.) The court \nfinds that Dr. Lombard is either insufficientl y familiar with his patients' records or mistaken if he \nbelieves Brown is only showing mild cognitive decline; Mr. Brown displayed significant \ncognitive impairment while testifying. \nMrs. Brown testified that while she observed some signs of Parkinson's-related \nmotor symptoms in 2019, Mr. Brown's cognition remained steady and did not significantly \ndecline until late 2022, following his \"near death\" experience with Covid-19, sometime mid-\n2022. (RT 3/5/25, p. 188, In. 12-16; RT 3/13/25, p. 129:17-131:20.) Although she then changed \nher testimony somewhat and said that she did not notice a cognitive impairment until sometime \nin 2023 (RT 3/5/25, p. 188-189), she later reaffirmed that her husband began to be cognitively \nimpaired in 2022. (RT 3/13/25 at p. 130: 5-24.) \nGiven this testimony (and that of the three legal assistants--Granillo, Navarro and Robinson-­\ndiscussed below), the court conclude s that plaintiff was beginnin g to show many symptoms of \nParkinson 's in 2019 and before, but that he continued to present as a cognitively functionin g \nindividual and was able to conduct routine legal business through at least 2020, as demonstrated \nby the various documents he was drafting in that period. By the second day of his testimony at \ntrial, it appeared to the court that he had very little recollection of the events that occurred in \n2019 through 2023. For example, he could not even recall whether he \"practiced law\" in 2021, \n2022 or 2023, the years in which his lawyers contend he was still able to practice but had his \nclients stolen from him. (RT 1/23/25, p. 42:2-12.) Accordingly , the court could give little \nweight to his testimony, except where it was corroborated by other testimony or evidence. \nBrown testified that he recognized the lease to the suite of offices he rented in 2019 on \nWilshire Blvd.. He claims he never agreed that Norris could take over the lease or become a \nsubtenant, which would have required written authorization from the landlord based on the \nwritten terms of the lease. (RT 1/22/25, p. 95:18-98: 28, and Exh. 19.) He also explained that he \nnever said Norris could use his law firm's personnel. (Id., at 103:15 -21.) But later, somewhat \ninconsistently, he testified that he told Norris that Norris could use Brown's rented offices for \nNorris's law practice \"several years into the lease term.\" (Id., at 103:1-20.) \nAt trial Brown claimed that he had no knowledge of any deal to transfer his cases to \nNorris. He claims Pak never told him that her agreement with the Baird firm had terminated. \n(RT 1/22/25, p. 101 :2-7.) He denies ever having a meeting with Pak and Norris to discuss \ntransfer of cases to Norris. (Id., at 102: 23-27.) He never agreed to transfer the \"bulk of his\" \ncases to Norris. (Id., at 102:28-103: l 0.) He never told anyone that Norris was a litigator with \nhis firm, nor did he authorize anyone to tell third parties that Norris was a litigator with his firm. \n(Id., at p. 105:2-16.) When shown Exhibit 1379, he testified that he did not authorize anyone to \nsend this letter but then conceded that the signature at the bottom could be his own. He claimed \nto have no recollection of the letter. (Id., at p. 105:26-p. 107:15, and Exh. 1379.) He denies I 4 "}, {"page": 5, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 authorizing anyone to tell clients in ~n~ ?f their _mass tort cases (\",~M m_ilitary e_arbuds\") th~t he \nwas transferring the case from one div1s1on of his law firm to the Norns associate branch. (Id., \nat 109:2-10.) Nonetheless, he acknowledged that he wrote Exhibit 1638, an email _to a legal. \nassistant with his firm, revising the notice he had to send to clients as a result of his suspension, \nwhich specifically named Don Norris (and another attorney) as attorneys to contact \"if anything \ncomes up with [the client's] case\" during his three months suspension. (Exh. 1638, 1/22/25, pp. \n110:3-113:9.) While he claims he had no knowledge that Pak was going to be working for . \nNorris as his office manager in the April 2020 time frame, he admitted that Pak had shown him \nthe draft of an agreement she and Norris were drawing up in the July 2019 time frame. (1/22/25 \nat 113:10-114:28.)1 \nThe court also received into evidence Exhibit 1573, a series of text messages between \nBrown and Pak. Tellingly, on April 26, 2020, Pak and Norris have an exchange in which Pak \ncriticized Brown for making a \"business deal with Jeff David\" and referring \"questions cases to \nhim.\" She asserted \"our clients already have own new lawyer why they asking questions to their \ncase to Jeff.\" Instead of denying that the clients had a new attorney, Brown responded: \"No \narrangement with Jeff. He would be backup if DN is not available or not interested \" Exh. \n1573, p. 3 (emphasis added.).) This text was followed by a barrage of text messages from Pak \nover the next two months, talking about the problems with various cases, including statute of \nlimitation problems and 154 cases with serious problems which had been transferred into \nNorris's name. Brown's only response was to direct her to transfer the problematic cases back to \nhim. At no time in this series of text messages over this several month period did Brown express \nany discomfort or disagreement with the transfer of cases to Norris, nor did he give Pak any real \nguidance about what to do with the SOL problems and other legal problems she was finding. \nThis series of text messages is strong evidence that Brown agreed that the cases should be \ntransferred to Norris and that he was providing little to no oversight to Pak, a nonlawyer, about \nwhat to do with the remaining cases or questions that were being raised and problems that were \nbeing uncovered. \nBrown also admitted that he entered into an agreement with Norris on November 16, \n2020 whereby Brown agreed to accept 80% of all attorney fees received relative to the Androge l \ntestosterone gel mass tort cases previously handled by Brown's office. (RT 1 /22/25, p. 1I7:10-\n1 19: 15 and Exh. I.) He could not recall any conversations with Pak about the percentage chosen \nbut agrees he voluntarily signed this agreement. Upon further examination at trial, he confessed \nthat he has no memory of this agreement or the Androgel case. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 38:2-41 :6.) \nAlthough he acknowledges his signature on the document, he does not have any memory of \n1 Both counsel for Pak and Brown expressed some consternation on the record about Brown's \ntestimony in this regard, and the court expressed concern that Browri was not reviewing \ndocuments before testifying about them, but Brown's attorney did not seek to withdraw Brown \nas a witness or to clarify or correct this testimony on the day it was given. Thus, Brown testified \nthat he was aware in July 2019 that Pak and Norris were drawing up an agreement to give her \n90% ofNorris's mass tort practice, when supposedly Pak was still working for Browri to develop \nand maintain his mass tort practice. On the following day of testimony, clearly after coaching by \nhis counsel, Brown testified that he had not seen this document until it was produced in \ndiscovery. (1/23/25 at p. 21:16-28.) The court places little weight on Brown's admission in \ncourt, as he appears to lack the mental capacity to understand much of what he was saying or \nbeing asked. \n5 "}, {"page": 6, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 entering into this or any other agreement with N~rr~s. (I~.) He di? acknowledge sending en:ails \nto Pak in November 2020, discussing their negot1at10ns with Norns about the percentage split. \n(Interestingly Pak was demanding 50% of the fees received on Andro~el, a demand on her part \nwhich would have created serious ethical issues for an attorney accepting those terms.) (RT \n1/28/25 p. 48, ln. l -52, In. 5.) \nBrown claims it was not until June 2023 that he first became suspicious that Pak was not \nworking exclusive ly for him and that there was anything amiss with his mass tort practice.2 He \nclaims he first realized there was something wrong when he sent an email to Pak, asking for an \nupdate on some of their cases. (RT 1/22/25 p. 119: 19 -122:28 and Exh. 1651.) In that email he \nasked for client name, case type, when the complaint was filed, summary of claim facts and \nwhen case would be completed and closed from a legal assistant. (Id., and Exh. 1651.) Pak's \nresponse was largely incomprehensible and aggressive, telling him her contract with Brown was \n\"voided,\" but oddly not directly stating that all of the cases had been transferred to Donald \nNorris. Around this same time, Brown contacted a former paralegal Lucas Granillo, with whom \nhe was still in contact, and asked Granillo to \"check on the status of a few cases.\" Granillo went \non Pacer to investigate some of their federal cases and found that Norris had been substituted \ninto many cases. Granillo testified that Norris seemed \"surprised\" by this news. (RT 2/14/25 at \np. 94:1-96:27 .) \nWith respect to the decision to enter the office suite at 3055 Wilshire, Brown appeared to \nhave little recollection of the decisions leading up to that step. He claims he did not know they \nwere going to bring a computer expert to copy files or retain a security company to accompany \nthem. (RT 1/27/25 am, p. 29:24-33:4.) He denies that he or his wife were the decision-maker s \nin barring Norris from the offices after October 21, 2023. (Id., at p. 35:24-36:19.) Later in his \ntestimony, Brown changed his testimony , explaining that he decided to have security accompany \nthem because he feared there might be violence; and that he went to the office with the intent to \nremove Norris from the offices with the use of security. (RT 1/28/25 at p. 68: l 5-25.) Brown \nsigned the actual agreement with the security company and the computer forensics company that \ncopied Norris's files. (Exh. 1657 and 1658.) \nTestimony of Richard Holstrom \nPlaintiffs offered the testimony of forensic accountant Richard Holstrom to quantify his \nclaimed damages and to provide expert testimony on law firm accounting. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 32-\n25.) Holstrom testified that, based on his review of the bank account records, in 2019 and 2020, \nPak and Brown received roughly equal payments from the law firm during those years. (RT \n3/7/25, p. 34: 17 -p. 42: 10 Exh. 1697, 1699, 1700.) He further confirmed that the money that wa \npaid to purchase leads from the Brown business account appears to have come from money \ntransferred into the account by Pak and that Brown had full access to these records in 2019 and \n2020 (and beyond). (RT 3/7/25, pp. 44-46.) Holstrom also presented lengthy testimony about \nthe attorney fees Brown should have received from the cases transferred to Norris. The court \ndoes not summarize this testimony because, as discussed further below, the court finds Brown is \nnot entitled to any portion of these fees. \n2 Around the same time, Brown claims he also discovered that the website for the Donald Norris \nlaw firm contained a link or \"protected page,\" which included information about Baird Brown, \nwell as Brown's photograph. (Exh. 1558 and 1652.) \n6 "}, {"page": 7, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n1 l \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Testimony of Ann Brown \nPlaintiff Ann Brown testified to several key issues in this case. First, she testified that her \nhusband did not want to retire when he was first diagnosed with Parkinson's in June 2019, nor at \nany time thereafter. (RT 3/5/25, p. 160:3-p.161 :5.) She acknowledges that her husband had \nback surgery at the end of 2019, from which he had a long recovery period. He could not drive \nfor an extended period. (Id., at p. 161 :6-p. 162: 12.) Nonetheless, she claims he never told her \nhe wanted to retire. (Id.) She admits that from March 2020 until the early part of 2023, he did \nnot go to work except occasionally on weekends. Nonetheless, she claims he still continued to \nwork from home and to communicate with Pak on a daily basis and expressed no interest in \nretiring. (Id., at p. 162:6-p. 163: 12.) She maintained this position at trial despite the fact that she \nalso acknowledged that in January 2022 her husband developed Covid, \"nearly died,\" was placed \non a ventilator and had to be hospitalized for a month, after which he was in inpatient care for a \nperiod of time and then at home receiving therapy. As far as the court can determine , Baird \nBrown appears to have been virtually incapacitated due to Covid for at least 4 to 5 months. (Id., \nat p. 164: 10-167: 10.) Mrs. Brown confirmed that during the entire time that he was hospitalized \nto her knowledge there was no attorney taking responsibility for any of his cases. (Id., at p. 186.) \nMrs. Brown also claims that she was aware that the Brown firm was purchasing leads in \nthe amount of $635,000 in June 2019, which she thought was inadvisable. Her husband told her \nthat it was a good business investment. (Id., at p. 169, ln. 17-170, In. 22.) The court found this \ntestimony unlikely, given that her testimony was imprecise and she admitted that at this same \ntime her husband was not telling her the truth about one key issue -that he was under \ninvestigation by the state bar and facing a one-year suspension. (TR 3/13/25, p. 133:8-26.) \nIndeed, she only learned about the investigation and his suspension because Pak shared this \ninformati on with her when Baird was hospitalized with Covid in 2022; Mrs. Brown \nacknowledged that because her husband was \"embarrassed,\" he hid this information from her for \nthree years. (Id.) She also indicated that she had no knowledge of her husband entering any kind \nof relationship with Norris, while it is undisputed from the records that Brown approved the \nsubstitution of Norris onto the Roh case (discussed below) and signed a written agreement to \ngive him 20% of all of proceeds from the Androgel cases. Apparently , there was a lot of \ninformati on that Baird did not share with his wife. She also testified that she was aware that her \nhusband had been retained by the Mick family in 2014, but that her husband told her he was \ndoing nothing on the case. (3/13/25 RT pp. 125-128.) This further supports the court's \nconclusion that Brown knew he needed another attorney to handle cases, the Mick case being \njust one of them. \nMrs. Brown also acknowledged what was clear from the other evidence -throughout the \nentire period that Baird Brown now claims he was deprived of his case load and deluded about \nNorris's involvement, Baird had full access to SugarSync, his office's case management system, \nand would have seen that legal work was being performed by Norris. In addition, he had access \nto his business and trust accounts and would have seen that he was no longer receiving fees from \nmost of his cases. Again, this evidence supports a finding that either Brown thought his cases \nwere being magically (and illegally) prosecuted by his legal assistants, or he knew that Norris \nwas handling his case load based on their agreement. \nMrs. Brown testified that she believes that as a result of Pak and Norris's conduct, she \n7 I "}, {"page": 8, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n1 l \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 has been damaged in the following ways. She has lost her \"retirement\" and millions in dollars in \nfees from lucrative cases in which her husband had invested through the purchase of leads. She \ndid not quantify her damages further. She did not describe her emotional distress, a~thoug~ it \nwas obvious to the court from her testimony that she was deeply upset by the financial straits she \nand her husband now face. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 188-193.) \nTestimony of Carolina Navarro \nMrs. Brown's testimony was contradicted by that of Carolina Navarro, a former client of \nMr. Brown's, who worked for the firm in 2019. Navarro testified that in 2019, she was tasked \nwith driving Baird Brown to doctor's appointment s, during which he complained to her about \n\"shakiness.\" During this same time, he told her that he was \"coming to an end with the law \nfirm.\" (RT 3/7/25. p. 116:17-118 :17.) She also recalls three meetings, either with Brown \npresent or with Brown on the phone, in which his leaving the practice of law was discussed: a \nmeeting sometime \"before summer\" of2019; a second meeting over Zoom towards the end of \n2019 where the staff was present in Pak's office and Mr. Brown was on the phone and \"a lot of \ncases were discussed\" and a third, in person meeting. (Id., p. 118:27-121:28; p. 139:6-141:9.) It \nwas at the last meeting that she met Norris for the first time. Navarro places this meeting \nsometime in 2020. At this meeting, Brown and Pak introduced Norris to the office staff, telling \nthem that Norris was going to be working on some of their cases. (Id., at p. 138:8 -p. 139:5.) \nShe also confirmed that she had a conversation with Mr. Brown and Pak in which she was told \nthat some of the 3M cases were going to be transferred to Norris and for her for work on those \ncases with Norris. (Id., at p. 142:2-148:27.) Although Ms. Navarro's dates appeared confused , \nthe court found her to be an extremely credible and even guileless witness, who appeared \ngenuinely to like and care for Mr. Brown and his wife. \nTestimony of Michelle Pak \nMichelle Pak's testified at length about her dealings with both law firms. She was paid \n50% of the firm's profits from the outset of her job with the Brown Law firm, commencing in \n200 l until late in the \"Covid lock down period.\" (RT 1/27 /25, p. 10: 13-11 :28; RT 1/22/25, p. \n100:1-17; RT 1/22/25, p. 100:18-25.) Pak explained that she oversaw the office and did all of \nthe marketing for the firm; she was responsible, she claimed, for bringing in all of the clients for \nthe firm's mass tort practice. (RT 2/7/25, p. 69: 12-70:6.) As part of her agreement with Brown, \nshe advanced the costs of marketin g and purchasing leads, for which she was reimbursed first \nwhen the firm received money; after that amount was reimbursed, she received a 50% share of \nthe remaining profits. (Id., at p. 70:3-21.) She denied handling any of the legal work, including \nsettlements. (Id., at p. 71 :ln 8-72: 5.) \nPak testified that sometime in May or June 2019, Brown told her that he had been \ndiagnosed with Parkinson's and that he was going to be retiring to focus on his health. He \nadvised her to find a new attorney to take over their office's mass tort practice and to enter into a \nnew profit-sharing arrangement with that attorney. (RT 1/27/25, p. 50:16-55:20; RT 2/5/25, p. \n17: 19-21: 12.) He told her he was very fatigued and needed to engage in many treatments to \naddress his health condition and so intended to retire. (2/7/25 RT p. 75:17-77:5.) Perhaps \ninconsistently, she testified that he appeared very strong and healthy, went to the gym every day \nand was still actively managing his case load during this period. (Id., at p. 77: 12 to 78:2.) Luc \nGranillo confirmed that in the first few months of 2020, Brown hobbled a pit and his hands \n8 "}, {"page": 9, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 shook, but he seemed to be mentally alert and able to run his firm, just as he had in the past. (RT \n2/14/25, p. 101-102.) \nAround this same time, May or June of 2019, Pak claims she told Brown that in light of \nhis decision to retire, her contractual relationship with him was terminated. Later in her \ntestimony , she placed this conversation as early as April 2019, explaining that it was \nimmediatel y after the MRI which diagnosed Brown with Parkinson 's. Even later in her \ntestimony, she stated that June 2020 was the first time that she told him that their contract was \nvoided. (RT 2/14/25 RT at p. 21 :6 -22:3.) With leading, she then corrected herself again and \nsaid the first time she told Brown their agreement was voided was June 2019. (Id., at p. 22:13-\n25.) Then she doubled down and stated that she told him their contract was voided in June 2020. \nDespite all this prevaricating, she claims that Brown and she discussed at some uncertain time \nthat she could continue to work in the office, overseeing the settlement of their cases, handling \nthe medical liens, and she was told to finish the work, even that which an attorney should do. \nShe tried to communicate with Brown in the ensuing months about some of the cases as they \nwound up, but she asserts he expressed little interest in them, particularly the low value cases. \n(Id., at p. 23:3 top. 27:23.) \nPak claims that when Brown told her that he wanted to retire in 2019, he explained that \nhe wanted to keep only a few of the individual personal injury cases. He informed her he did not \nwant to keep the mass tort cases because they took two to six years to complete. (RT 2/7/25, p. \n80: 10-28.) He also wanted to retain some cases which had \"already settled,\" like the Androgel \ncase. (Id.) With respect to the Androgel case, he told Pak because it was nearly completely \nsettled, he wanted Norris to take it over, for an 80/20 fee split in Brown's favor. (Id., at p. 81: 13-\n25.) \nPak testified that although she was aware that Brown was the subject of a state bar \ninvestigation in 2019 (and had hired an attorney to represent him in that matter), she was \nshocked to find out in March of 2020 that the bar was going to suspend him. He had not told her \nthat he might be suspended. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 78:3 -p. 80:9.) \nShe gave conflicting testimony about when she first met Norris and when they began to \nwork together. In her deposition , she claimed that she first started working for Norris after \nBrown's suspension became effective on April 1, 2020. (RT 1/27/25 p.m., p. 42:8 -44:20.) Yet \nshe also admitted that she signed a document on July 30,2019, nearly a year earlier, which she \nclaims Norris drafted, which would have had her receive 90% ofNorris's mass-tort practice. (Id., \nat p. 39: 1 to p. 42: 7, and Exh. 1512.) She further claimed that it was Brown who suggested she \ndraw up the agreement reflected in Exh. 1512 and 1670, when she and Brown met in Brown's \noffice in June 2019 to discuss his Parkinson's diagnosis. In this conversation, Pak claims he told \nher that she should enter into a profit-sharing arrangement with Norris and even encouraged her \nto ask for 90% of the profits. (Id., at p. 50, In. 16-p. 55, In. 20.) She conceded that the 90% spli \nof profits she was discussing with Norris was far more lucrative than the 50% share she received \nfrom the Brown firm. (RT 2/14/25 TR, p. 122:20-125:5.) \nAlthough she testified on one day that she first started working with Norris after April 1, \n2020, she testified elsewhere that in February 2020, she contacted one of Baird's clients, Hyung \nRoh, and told him that his case was going to be transferred to Don Norris and sent him a \nSubstitution of Attorney form which had been prepared by Brown. She claims that in February \n9 I "}, {"page": 10, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 2020 she knew that Brown was going to be suspended as they had already discussed it, along \nwith his intention to retire, contradicting her earlier testimony that she did not know about his \nsuspension until April 2020. (RT 2/5/25 at 24:9-p. 28: 13 and Exh. 16_7 l) She maintains that \nshe was still acting as Brown's office manager when she sent the substitution documents to Roh \nand explained to him that the case was being transferred to Norris. (Id., at 36, Ins. 16-21.) She \nalso admitted at trial that she knew the Roh case was a \"multimillion \" dollar case. (Id., at 40, 18-\n21.) She claims she told Roh that the case was being transferred to Norris because of Brown's \nsuspension and because he intended to retire. (Id., at 31, Ins. 20-26.) She admitted that at the \ntime she knew that Brown had associated in Brian Panish as co-counsel only a month earlier but \nexplains that it was her understanding that the Panish firm was only going to help with \nsettlement, not actual litigation . (Id., at 29, In. 4-p. 30, In. 16; and Exh. 1527.) Realizing her \nnumerou s inconsistencies, she then testified that Brown discussed with her that he was going to \nbe suspended before March 2020. (Id., at p. 34, ln. 4-25.) She was impeached with her \ndeposition testimony where she stated that he did not tell her about the suspension until the end \nof March and she did not tell Norris about it until after they received the suspension letter. \n(Depo. Transcript, p. 117:10-18 ; pp.234:5-235:10.) \nPak was questioned about the timing of the process for obtaining substitution of attorney \nforms from Brown's clients. With respect to the Roh case, she admitted that substitution of \nattorney form had been sent to the Roh family on or about February 21, 2020, to replace Brown \nwith the Norris law firm, but was not signed by Baird Brown until April 13, 2020. (RT 1/27/25, \np. 18:22-p. 21 :25, and Exh. 1653 and 1655.)3 She denied that Brown had taken significant \ndeposition s in the case, testifying instead that Norris conducted the bulk of the work in the case, \nultimately settling it for $2.5 million. (Id., at 26:9-28:21.) She also testified Brown took less \nthan the 40% provided for in the retainer agreement and concedes that her daughter was repaid \nout of the settlement proceeds for money her daughter had allegedly lent to the plaintiff to cover \nhis living expenses. (Id., at p.28:26 -33:7.) For reasons that were never adequately explained, \nshe was paid $300,000 out of the Roh settlement proceeds, while the attorney on the case -\nDonald Norris- received only $70,000. (Id., at p. 44:17-28; RT 2/5/25 at p. 43:15-19.) No \nmoney was set aside from the Roh settlement to satisfy a lien from Brown and he asserted no \nlien, to Pak's knowledge. (2/5/25 at p. 44, In. 8-13.) \nPak testified that under her contractual agreement with Brown, even if the contract was \nterminated she was still required to \"see to the books\" and the accounting until all of the cases \nwere finished and all of the medical liens satisfied. (RT 1/27/25, p. 67:4-19.) She claims she \nperformed these services diligently after April 2020, trying to finish up the various cases in \nBrown's case load. (RT 2/14/25, p. 126:22-127:6.) Pak claimed that she paid all of the \noperating expenses out of the Baird Brown Business Account. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 72:6 -15.) Pak \n3 Although the court agreed with Brown's counsel that the substitution appeared to have been \ndoctored to change the Norris law firm name and address, which is not proper, Brown appears to \nhave signed the substitution on April 13, 2020, indicating that he knew the case was being \ntransferred to Norris. Roh also appears to have agreed to the substitution. The court did not find \nthis altered document to be evidence that Norris deceived Brown into transferring the case. \n(Exh. 1653 and 1654, 1655.) There was no persuasive evidence that Norris knew anything abou \nthe manipulation of the address line. (RT 2/28/25 at p. 45-47.) The court finds it more likely \nthan not that Pak oversaw manipulation of the document to ensure that the substitution was \naccurate for purposes of the court, without either Norris or Brown's knowledge. \n10 "}, {"page": 11, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 claimed that Brown came into the office once a month or once every other month and reviewed \nthe bills and rent statements, which was consistent with Baird Brown and his wife's testimony \nabout his regular practices. (RT 1/27/25, p. 72:21-73:6.) She claims that every ch~ck she wrote \non this account was approved by Brown. (RT 2/14/25 RT at p. 28:20-29:5.) Later m her \ntestimony, she conceded that for checks she wrote, she did not get pre-approval but she would \nanswer Brown's questions if he had any. (Id., at p. 29: 17-25.) \nThe Brown firm had a five-year lease for office space at 3055 Wilshire Blvd. (Exh. 19), \nwhich commenced April I, 2019, with monthly rental payments of approximately $3000 per \nmonth with scheduled increases. Monthly rent was paid out of Brown's operating expenses. (RT \n1/27/25, p. 56: 1 to 57:22 and Exhibit 19.) In 2019, Michelle Pak signed the checks, paying their \nmonthly office lease out of Brown's operating account (See Exh. 7, p. 43, check No. 6914.) Pak \nidentified her signature on Check No. 6914, which the court finds to be a distinctive signature \nand quite different than Baird Brown's signature, which also appeared on checks written off the \noperating account. Pak was still writing checks for rent and office parking spaces to the \nbuildings' owners and Standard Parking out of the Brown operating account throughout 2020, as \nwell as numerou s other checks. (1/27/25, p. 62:1-28 and Exh. 10.) Brown ceased to write \nchecks on the Operating Account sometime in 2020. (See Exh. 9.) Pak continued to pay the rent \nusing Brown's operating account throughout 2021, 2022 and 2023 (Exh. 13 and 15.) Pak claims \nthat she negotiated a reduction of the rent on behalf of the Baird Law Firm, lowering the rent to \n$1800 per month. She claims that she did this to benefit the Baird Law Firm and that it was done \nwith Brown's consent. (RT 2/10/25 at p. 8: 19-p, 9:28.) She acknowledged that Norris had no \nlegal right to negotiate the lease reduction because he was not on the lease and that Brown was \nnot present during these negotiation s. (RT 1 /27 /25, p. 66: 10 to p, 71 :20.) She acknowledges that \nthere was no written sublease between Brown and Norris. (RT 2/7/25 RT at p. 10:8-15.) She \nadmitted that Norris only made two payments (totaling $15,000) to the Brown firm to cover any \nof the expenses for the office. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 10: 25-12:8; RT 2/14/25 p. 31 :28-32:28, Exh. 11 \nand Exh. 1573.) However, she testified generally that whenever the office needed money for \nexpenses, either she would make a deposit to the Brown Business account or Norris would pay \nfor the expenses. She was only able to point to one such payment in the account records. \n(2/14/25 RT p. 35, ln. 27-and Exhibit 11, pp. 71-72.) \nNonetheless, the record also supports her claim that Brown expected her to continue their \noperations for some period of time to wind down the cases which had neared settlement or were \napproaching closure; and to allow him to continue to maintain some of his smaller personal \ninjury cases. She was authorized then, at a minimum , to continue renting the office space and \nmaintainin g their operation to handle these matters. \nWith respect to the Baird Brown Client Trust Account, both Brown and Pak had signing \nauthority. Throughout 2020 and 2021, Pak was signing checks disbursing funds from the \naccount, including payments to doctors, Baird Brown and others. In May of 2020, she signed \nchecks issued to Donald Norris Law firm for nearly $60,000. If Brown had been monitoring the \nClient Trust Account records, as he claimed he did, he would have seen these payments. (See \nExh. I 0.) The last check signed by Baird Brown on the Client Trust Account was signed by him \nin June 2020. Thereafter, only Pak's signature appears on checks drawn on the account, which \ncontinued until the end of 2022. In the last year for which the court has records (2022), very few \ntransactions were conducted on the Client Trust Account and the balance was no more than \n$50,000 (Exh. 12, 14.) Again, had Brown been monitoring the Client Trust Account, he would j \n11 I "}, {"page": 12, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 have known that no payments were being received from clients either b~ way of settlement or \nother means. All parties acknowledge that Brown had access to the Client Trust account at all \ntimes and could have seen all the checks she wrote. (2/7/25 RT at p. 73:15-25.) \nPak was questioned about payments made from the Baird Brown checking account ending \n3119. She confirmed that the following payments were made to purchase leads for mass tort \ncases: $195,000 was paid to Broughton Partners on May 14, 2019, $48,500 to Sequoia Media \nGroup on May 31, 2019, another $100,000 to Sequoia and $40,000 to On Point Legal on August \n19, 2019, $135,000 on October 22, 2019 to Broughton Partners, and$ I 35,000 on October 23, \nalso to Broughton. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 18: 9-20:21, and Exh. 7.) She claimed that all of these \npayments were made with her money, even though the payments were made from the Baird \nBrown business account. (Id.) She admitted that she was making these payments to purchase \nleads for the Norris law firm, starting as early as May 24, 2019. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 24:27-27:21.) \nShe then altered her testimony and stated that she did not start working for Norris until the end o \nJune or early July 2019. (Id., at p. 28, In. 19-25.) (As stated above, this testimony at trial \ncontradicted her deposition testimony.) She claims that Brown approved this method of paying \nfor leads for Norris: putting the money into the Brown business account so it could be written off \nas a business expenses for the Brown firm, but then used by the Norris firm. (2/14/25 pp. 38-\n41.) As trial went on, Pak's testimony changed yet again about who she purchased the leads for, \nundermining her credibility further. (RT 2/14/25 RT at pp. 45-49.) \nUltimately, Pak claims she invested $4 million of her own money between April 1, 2020 and \nOctober 2023 purchasing leads for Norris's law firm. (2/10/25 RT at p. 11, 4 to 8.) She testified \nthat it was her intent to become an investor in his firm and that she expected to be paid back \n\"dollar for dollar\" for the money she had invested in the firm through the purchase of leads. (RT \n2/14/25 at pp. 122-123.) \nOf the $635,000 which came from Brown's business account to purchase leads, she \nexplained $100,000 was in her \"account\" based on her taking less than her full draw in February \n2019; $335,000 she wired in to the account and $230,000 was a note she took over from Brown. \n(RT 2/14/25 at p. 50:18-58:10.) As Pak explained, Brown had borrowed $230,000 from Ms. \nNavarro, his former client and sometime legal assistant; by assuming his debt, she was able to \ntake $230,000 out of his business account to purchase leads. Ms. Navarro confirmed that Pak \ntook over this loan. \nPak testified that at the end of May or early June 2019, she had a conversation with Brown \nabout transferring his case load to a new attorney. Brown told her to look for an attorney to tak \nover the mass tort cases. At the time of this conversation, she did not yet know Norris. She \nclaims she told a friend that she was looking for an attorney and the attorney connected her with \nNorris, pointing out that both Norris and Brown had gone to Stanford. She did not know Norris \nbefore that introduction was made. Pak testified that she told Brown she would be meeting wit \nNorris and he approved. (2.7.25 p. 87:21-91:26.) \nShe then met with Norris sometime in June, discussed the opportunity with him, and Norris \nagreed to meet with Brown. (RT 2/7/25, p. 93:8-28.) She set up a meeting with Norris and \nBrown on July 11, 2019; it was the first opportunity for the two attorneys to meet. Nonetheless, \nPak admitted at trial that she had already paid for and obtained leads supposedly for Norris and \nshe and Norris were drawing up sample letters of introduction to Brown's clients, which could b \n12 "}, {"page": 13, "text": "l \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 used to solicit them to transfer their case to Norris. (RT 2/14/25 Tr, p. 130-133, Exh. 1681 and \n1682.)4 She was part of the discussion between Norris and ~rown in which ~rown \ncommunicated that he wanted Norris to take over some of his cases. She claims that she was not \npresent during any discussion of the actual terms of the transfer. After the three of them met on \nJuly 11, they walked around the office and introduced Norris to the staff. She v:as never present \nat any discussion, nor did she see anything in writing between Brown and Noms about the terms \nof their transfer arrangement. (Id., at p. 93, ln. 23-p. 95, In. 12.) Legal Assistant Lucas Granillo, \nwhen questioned about this event, stated that he never saw Brown and Pak introduce Norris to \nthe office staff and never heard that it had happened in July 2019 or at any other time. (2/14/25 \nTr, p. 90, In. 17-p. 92, ln. 17.) \nShe claims Brown told her to \"finish up\" all of his individual personal injury cases, settling \nthe medical liens and completing the settlements, allowing her to continue to use the law offices' \nspace and personnel to do that while she was simultaneously helping Norris assume \nresponsibility for the mass tort cases and to buy new leads to increase that case load. (RT 2/7/25 \nat p. 100: 1-103:6.) Brown knew that Norris would be using the same office space, directing \nPak to make sure that the receptionist answered the phone with both the law firm of Baird Brown \nand the law firm of Donald Norris. (Id., at p. 103:7-18 .) She testified that once he was \nsuspended, Brown directed her to transfer the remainin g of the PI cases to Norris, with each \noffice paying for the staff time devoted to their cases. (Id., at p. l 05:3-16.) \nShe claims that Norris did not actually start working on the mass tort cases until after \nBrown's suspension on April 1, 2020. (2/7/25 RT at p. 95:13-25.) Pak testified (and it was \nundisputed by Brown) that Brown did not come into the office during ordinary work hours after \nhe was suspended for more than three years. She did not see him in the office again until \nOctober 21, 2023, when he came with attorneys and his wife to reclaim the space. (Id., at p. \n105: 19 -106: 18.)5 She did continue to communicate him throughout 2020 and 2021. She claims \nwork was sti II being done on some of his cases (presumably by legal assistants and not Brown), \nand that he continued to get paid on those cases. (Id., at p. 106: 19 -109:25.) \nPak concedes that communications were sent to clients of the Baird Brown law firm as early \nas January 2020, informing them that their case was being transferred to the Norris firm. She \nclaims that all these letters were first approved by Brown. The court agrees with Brown's \ncounsel that the letters were slightly misleading in that they suggested that Norris had been an \nassociated counsel with the Brown firm previously or that his law firm was already part of the \n4 Although Pak did not admit this, the court concludes that she likely purchased the leads in Ma \nwith the intent that they be used by B~own, but when Norris agreed to take over the practice, she \nthen began to identify and treat these as leads purchased for Norris. The court does not find that \nshe was prescient about being able to work with Norris, or that Norris had a deal or \nunderstanding prior to June 2019 that they would be working together in any capacity. \n5 Having first said that she did not see Brown once between April 1, 2020 and October 21, 2023 \nPak then changed her testimony and said he came onto the office every day. When the court \npointed out the inconsistency in her testimony, she corrected herself to say that she never saw \nhim but he was coming in on the weekend , that he continued to do payroll and was giving \ndirection to staff over the phone. (Id., at p. 105: 19 -106: 18.) The court placed little weight on \nher testimony as to Brown's level of involvement, since it was contradictory and not credible. \n13 "}, {"page": 14, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n1 1 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Brown Law Firm. There was no evidence presented that Norris instructed anyone to send these \nletters or that he took part in drafting them. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 30:9-34: 16 and E~h. 154.) Pak_also \nconfirmed that in late 2019 through early 2020, paralegals in the Brown Law Fmn were calling \nclients, encouraging them to switch to the Norris Law Firm. (Id., at 35:21-37: I 0.) Sh~ admitted \nthat the script used by their legal assistants was deceptive, as it described Donald Noms as an \n\"associate branch\" of the Brown Law Firm, which he was not. (Id.) Other deceptive \ncommunications were sent to clients in the December 2019 period, describing Norris as a \n\"litigation attorney\" in the Brown firm. (Id., at p 39: 17-46:9 and Exhs. 452, 1554, and 1558.) \nThe court finds it more probable than not that Pak was directing that these communications be \nsent by legal assistants in the firm. There was no evidence that Norris was aware of these \ncommunications. \nPak testified that she knew that an entire box of more than l 00 notice letters to clients, \nrequired to be sent by the State Bar, had not been sent to clients. She claims Brown told her not \nto send them and so they remained, sitting in a box, until October 2023 when Brown and his \nattorneys came to the office and requested that she leave. (RT 2/7/25, p. 50:7 -53:8.) \nUltimately, the court did not place much weight on this box of unsent letters. As stated \nelsewhere, the court does not believe Pak's testimony, given her general lack of credibility, Mr. \nBrown does not have sufficient memory to know what occurred with this box, and the court \ncould not see any particular gain to anyone that it was not sent. \nPak was present on October 21, 2023 when Brown, his wife, and his attorneys came to the \noffice with several other people. She was handed a termination letter, which was also read to her \nby Brown's attorneys. (RT 2/5/25 p. 55:17 -57:3.) During this incident, she repeatedly asserted \nto Brown's attorneys that all of the office equipment, furniture and computers were her personal \nproperty or purchased with her money. (Id.) \nOf the seven computers which she claimed to have purchased, only three have been \nreturned to her. (Id., at p. 58. Lns. 6-7.) When asked to provide invoices to prove that she had \npurchased the four other computers and their costs, she presented invoices she obtained from the \nvendor. Brown's counsel established that some of the invoices appear to be generated from \nearlier invoices. (RT2/7/25 atp. 13:8 -17:16.) \nTestimony of Bruce Pixley \nAlthough plaintiffs presented the evidence of computer expert Bruce Pixley, who questioned \nthe authenticit y and history of an email sent on April 24, 2020 which purportedly showed Brown \nreceiving email notification of some of the letters going out to clients, the court found this \ntestimony largely irrelevant given the other evidence that Brown was aware of and had approved \nthe plan to transfer the mass tort clients to Norris. The court also found largely irrelevant the \nextensive testimony presented by Pixley about whether information about Brown and his photo \nhad been briefly visible on Norris's website. As explained above, the court finds that Pak was \nprimarily responsible for overseeing and managing the transfer of cases; the court finds she also \nhired the people who put together the website. Given that Brown had approved the transfer, as \nthe court finds, the court finds it hardly surprising that some of the advertising materials used \ncontinued to make mention of Brown. The court did not find the use of Brown's image and \ninformation for some period of time on the website to be deceptive or injurious to Brown in any \nway. Both Brown and Norris would have benefited if clients thought they were associated, as it \n14 "}, {"page": 15, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 would have made it more likely that clients would agree to the transfer. Norris deni_ed hav!ng \nany knowledge about ~he creation _of the webs'.te, all of which was handled ,by a de_s1gne~ hired by \nPak. He testified credibly that while the website was modeled after Brown s, any inclusion of a \nphoto of Brown was inadvertent and likely not visible to the public_. (RT ~/5/25, p. 26:21-p. , \n28:6.) Indeed, he claimed he would not have wanted Brown on his website because of Browns \ndiscipline record. (Id., asp. 53.) \nUltimately, the court found Pixley's testimony did not support Brown's theory of the case in \nany meaningful way. \nTestimony of Lucas Granillo \nLucas Granillo was called by plaintiffs to testify about his experiences as a legal assistant at \nthe Brown law firm. Granillo started with the Brown firm in 2017 and left in May or June of \n2020. (RT 2/10/25 p.m., pp. 234: 16 -235:4.) He testified that during his employment with the \nfirm, Pak directed all his work, not Brown. However, if he did something that had to go to court, \nhe believes Brown would review it. (Id., at pp. 235:20-236:24.) \nSometime in 2020 (if not earlier), the office began the process of transferring Brown's cases \nto Norris. Pak told Granillo that Brown wanted his mass tort cases transferred to Norris. She \ntold him this change was due to Brown's health issues which made it hard for him to practice law \nand because he had a suspension approaching. Granillo never heard this directly from Brown. \n(RT 2/10/25 at p. 242: 1-24.) Pak directed him to contact the mass tort clients and tell them that \n\"Mr. Norris is going to absorb and take over Mr. Brown's mass tort claims, and that ... the same \nstaff and the same office were going to be working the cases.\" (Id., at p. 243:6-21.) He \nconfirmed that the various email communications with clients and scripts introduced into \nevidence were generally the types of communications that Pak directed him to send to existing \nclients to persuade them to transfer their cases to Norris. He confirmed that Norris was not an \nassociate of the firm, nor a branch or division of the Brown firm. (RT 2/14/25, pp. 67-87.) \nGranillo also confirmed that though he worked on legal matters for the Norris law firm at times \nbefore his departure in June 2020, he was always paid with a check drawn from the Baird Brown \nlaw firm. This amount was never quantified. (Id., at pp. 87-88.) \nTestimony of Taurin Robinson \nDefendant Taurin Robinson, a law clerk with the firm, also provided testimony. He \nexplained that he worked for the Brown firm from 2017 until the end of 2020. (RT 2/28/25 pp. \n58:21 -59:20.) He began to work as a legal assistant for the Norris firm in January 2021. (Id.) \nHe explained that he did some work \"here and there\" for Brown after the suspension. (Id., at pp. \n59:1-60:11.) His paychecks throughout 2020 were issued by the Brown law firm. However , he \ncontends that when he did work for Norris, he was separately paid by Norris. (Id. at p. 60: 12-\n23 .) Robinson , like Granillo, was asked to communicate with clients to ensure their smooth \ntransition to the Norris law firm. (Id., at pp. 63-67, 70.) Robinson testified that he believed what \nhe was doing was in Brown's best interest and at his instruction because Brown told them to \ntransfer the cases to Norris's firm. (Id., at p, 74:16-75:15.) He denied Brown having any \nmemory issues in 2019 and 2020. (Id., at p. 79.) \nRobinson claims that he participated in a Zoom meeting sometime during the early part of \n15 "}, {"page": 16, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 the Covid lockdown (and Brown's suspension) when they were all working from home; Brown \ninstructed them during this call to transfer all of the cases to Norris.6 During this call Brown \ninstructed them on how to transfer the cases, expressed a disinterest in continuing to practice law \nand told them that if they had any questions regarding cases to take the questions to Pak. (RT \n2/28/25, at pp. 80:2-83:3.) He explained that the process of transferring cases was confusing and \ndifficult, but the staff did the best they could. (id., at pp. 83-84.) He clarified that Brown was \nfairly hands off in the transfer process but nonetheless directing it. Norris played no role in \ndirecting the transfer process. (Id., at pp. 88:4 -89:4.) \nTestimony of Donald G. Norris \nNorris was questioned at length about his role in the transfer of cases and his counterclaims . \nHis testimony was at times argumentative, self-serving or evasive. Some of this may be \nexplained by the considerable hostility expressed by all of the attorneys towards each other -\nclients and their counsel -which may have made Norris unusually combative. Thus, he was \nunnecessarily cautious about identifying documents and sometimes contradicted himself about \nwhat he had signed and what he had not signed. This caution made him appear evasive or less \nthan credible at times. \nNonetheless , Norris did present credible testimony about his first encounter with \nMichelle Pak and the process by which he agreed to undertake to continue to represent many of \nBrown's clients as Brown wound down his law practice. Norris met Pak in May or June 2019, \nthrough an introduction by a mutual friend. (RT 3/5/25 at pp. 5-6.) Norris had known Brown by \nreputation previously and had even referred cases to him, as he knew him to be a competent and \nexperienced attorney. (Id .. ) Pak told him that Brown wanted to stop practicing law, as he had \nrecently been diagnosed with Parkinson's and he was looking for someone to transfer hundreds \nof cases too, many of which were product liability mass tort cases. Pak proposed that she remain \nas an office manager to manage the staff and obtain leads. He believes at their first meeting she \nproposed the same type of financial arrangement she had with Brown, namely a 50/50 split. (RT \n3/5/25 at pp. 6-9.) \nNorris told Pak he was interested in the prospect, and she arranged a meeting in the \nsecond or third week of July between Brown and Norris. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 12-13.) Before the \nmeeting, Pak assured Norris that Brown wanted to go ahead with transferring the cases. (RT \n3/5/25, pp. 15:27-16:4.) At the meeting in July 2019, Brown told Norris that he did not want to \npractice anymore and that he intended to retire. He stated that he wanted to transfer his cases \nover to Brown and would do whatever was needed to facilitate the transfer. Norris explained \nthat he was interested but not certain he wanted all the cases, as he did not know anything about \nthem. (RT 3/5/25 at pp. 12-13.) Significantly, Norris admitted that Pak began to purchase \nleads for his firm in June 2019, well before the meeting between Norris and Brown. He claims \nthat Pak told him that Brown had given his blessing to this arrangement. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 131-\n132.) Pak told him that she was paying for leads using her own money, but did not disclose to \nhim that she was passing that money through the Brown business account. (Id., at pp. 133-136.) \nNorris viewed the money that Pak paid for leads to obtain clients to be loans to his law firm, \nwhich would have to be repaid. (3/5/25 at pp. 137-142.) \n28 6Granillo denied being present on such a Zoom call or ever hearing that such a call had taken \nplace. (3/7/25 Tr., pp. 30: 17-31 :21.) \n16 "}, {"page": 17, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 The only group of cases for which there was a written agreement between the parties \nrelated to litigation over testosterone cream, referred to as the \"Androgel cases.\" (RT 3/5/25, pp. \n13:28 -14:24.) Norris testified that he received an email \"out of the blue\" drafted by Bro~, \nwhich provided that Norris would complete the cases and receive 20% of the attorney fees m \nexchange. (RT 2/28/25, pp. 13-20.) Through Norris's testimony and Exhibits 1, 2, 3 1446, and \n1686 to 1688, it is clear that Brown was well aware that Pak was acting as Norris's manager, as \nBrown exchanged multiple emails with her about the split of the Androgel fees in the November \n2020 period, in which Pak was negotiating on behalf of Norris, not Brown. (RT 2/28/25 at pp. \n25-36 and Exh. 1446.) Norris testified that Brown was fully paid his 80% of the Androgel fees. \n(RT 3/5/25, p 15.) Brown never asked for a fee split on any of the other cases that were \ntransferred to Norris. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 67-68.) \nNorris had no good explanation why there was no written agreement between himself and \nBrown for the transfer of the other mass tort cases. (RT 2/28/25, pp. 37-40.) Norris testified \nsimply that they had an oral agreement that Norris would be taking over these other cases, \nreached initially in July 2019, and then affirmed by their conduct and subsequent conversations \nover the next many months. (Id.) Defendant s' counsel established that even though Brown had \nNorris's emajl and phone number, Brown never wrote to him (or spoke with him) to demand \npayment on any case or to express disagreement with Norris' involvement in these cases until \nyears later in 2023. (RT 3/5/35 pp. 14-15.) \nWith respect to the Roh case, Norris testified that the case had been filed by Brown on \nbehalf of an injured truck driver. Norris believed that it could be a high value case due to the \nnature of the plaintiffs injuries and need for significant future medical care. When he became \naware of the case, very little had been done and no discovery had been taken. He was able to go \ninto the Brown office's SugarSync system and see the work that had been done, as well as what \nhad not been done. Norris put \"a lot of hours\" into the case, including conducting all discovery \nand handling settlement negotiations. While the Parush Shea & Boyle case had done some work \non the case, Norris concluded that their work on the case had terminated upon an early mediation \nand that their lien had no validity. The Panish firm ultimately dropped their claim for payment. \n(RT 3/5/25, pp. 68-73, and Exh. 416.) Norris confirmed that the case ultimately settled for $2.5 \nmillion, from whjch the Norris law firm took attorney fees of $632,000. While they were entitled \nto more, Norris personally only received approximately $60,000 from the Roh settlement , as \nover $500,000 was used to buy new leads, pay off loans from Pak, and pay office expenses . (Id. \nat pp. 74-77, and Exh. 1656.) He conceded that $261,000 of the attorney fees was transferred to \nPak but cannot reconstruct precisely what that payment was for, as all of his notes were taken by \nthe Whites and plaintiffs on October 21, 2023. (Id., at 78-79.) \nNorris concedes his firm also received a large settlement for the \"Roundup\" mass tort \ncases, for which Pak was paid $874,000. He testified that this constituted repayment to Pak for \nthe money she had paid to purchase leads of clients in the Roundup cases. (Id., at 79-80.) \nAt Pa.k's direction , sometime in July 2019, Norris drafted a compensation agreement to \ngovern her work with his firm. Although he drafted it at Pa.k's direction, Pak told him that \nBrown had reviewed it and told her it \"looked good.\" (RT 3/5/25, p.16:20 -17:9.) Brown \nexplained he never signed the agreemen t because he was not sure it was \"kosher\" under the \nethics rules and he wanted to see how their business together progressed. (3/5/25, pp. 17: 12 -\n17 "}, {"page": 18, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n1 1 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 18:2.)7 While Norris declined to sign this agreement which would have given Pak 90% of his \npractice's net profits, after cases settled, it was his practice to decide a \"fair\" amount to pay Pak \nbased on the hours she had worked and other unspecified factors. He also sought to ensure that \nshe was repaid for any loans she had made to the firm or advanced to buy leads. (RT 3/5/25 at \npp. 62-65.) \nNorris was aware that Brown's cases were being transferred to him, commencing in the \nfust quarter of 2020, although there may have been a few that transferred in December 2019. \nBrown never voiced any objection to the transfer and Norris believed that he was fully on board \nwith the plan to wind down his practice and transfer his cases to Norris. (RT 3/5/25, p. 18:3 -\n19:28.) Norris played no role in the transfers, which were handled entirely by Brown's office \nstaff. He denies directing the process or being involved in the paperwork or interactions with \nclients. (id. and RT 3/5/25, pp. 82:24-83:6.) There was no evidence presented by plaintiff to \nshow that he participated in the process. \nAlthough Norris had wanted to move all of the case files to his own office in downtown \nLos Angeles, Pak persuaded Norris to continue to continue to handle the cases out of the Brown \nlaw offices in Korea town. She told Norris that Brown felt more comfortable keeping them in \nhis own office because they had once been his clients and he wanted Norris to continue to use his \nstaff to work on those cases. (RT 3/5/25, at p. 59.) Norris never discussed the rent of the Korea \ntown offices with Brown. Instead, Pak told him that \"she was covering it.\" He does recall being \nasked to pay $15,000 towards the rent at some point by Pak, which he did, but he does not recall \nthe specifics. (id., at p. 59:26-60:24.) He did not provide any testimony or evidence to \nestablish that he paid any other office expenses, rent, or staff costs for the Wilshire Avenue \noffices during the period in question (April 2020 to October 21, 2023). \nNorris confirmed that Brown represented Norris and Brown in malpractice litigation \nbrought against both of them by an heir to one of their clients, known as the \"Mick case.\" \n(3/5/25 pp. 21 :8.-p. 22: 13.) Throughout his representation of Norris on that case, Brown never \nmentioned that he believed he should have been paid by Norris for any of the cases Norris had \nbeen handling. (id.) \nNorris was not present when the Browns and their attorneys went to the offices on \nWilshire on October 21, 2023, and ejected Pak and Norris. He met with the Whites a few days \nafterwards at Starbucks. At that meeting, the Whites accused Norris of having stolen cases from \nBrown, which Norris denied; he explained to the Whites that the cases had been transferred to \nhim by Brown. Norris told the Whites that there were many files in the office belonging to his \nclients -clients who had never been represented by the Brown law firm -to which he needed \naccess. The Whites agreed that Norris could go with them to the suite to identify those files, \nwhich they did that same day, but Norris claims he was only provided 45 minutes to go through \n, The court observes that both firm's agreements with Pak were unsavory and may have \nbordered on unethical. Because both firms appeared to employ this same unusual business \nmodel of paying for leads to solicit clients and then at times appearing to pay Pak, a non-lawyer, \na percentage of fees recovered, neither complained about the other's practices or presented law \nor argument about these practices. Accordingly , the court does not express any opinion or \nfindings about the legality or ethics of these practices, beyond observing that both lawyers seem \nto have used poor judgment and disregard of ethical constrictions in their involvement with Pak. \n18 "}, {"page": 19, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n1 1 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 the file cabinets -not enough time to review them all. (RT 3/5/25, p. 87:1-p.89:8.) \nNorris claims that he had his laptop with him during the Starbucks meeting and that his \nlaptop was left permanently \"on\" in his computer bag, such that anyone could gain access to all \nof files on that computer simply by refreshing the screen; one did not have to enter a password. \nHe testified that after he left the Wilshire Suite, he realized that he did not have his lap top bag. \nHe went back to Starbucks to look for it, but it was not there. He then called the Whites at the \nWilshire office and asked them whether he had left the bag in the suite. He claims the Whites \nrefused to let him enter to look for it. Subsequently , he received some \"strange\" communications \nfrom his File and ServeXpress account (required for filing and service in certain cases), which \nindicated that the Brown firm was interfering with his ability to receive court documents. He \nwas not able to place a cost on this alleged interference with his files and the court found his \ntestimony highly speculative . (RT 3/5/25, pp. 94-104.) The court is not persuaded that the \nplaintiffs or the Whites stole and accessed his laptop; there was insufficient evidence presented \nas to why an error occurred with Norris's File and ServeXpress account. \nPrior to October 21, 2023, staff at the Wilshire office answered the phone: \"Law Office \nof Baird Brown and Law Office of Donald Norris.\" After that date, if someone called asking for \nNorris or his firm, the person answering the phone would state: \"Mr. Norris is no longer at this \nnumber.\" (RT 3/5/25 pp. 107:17-109:17.)8 Norris did sign a stipulation on October 31, 2023-\nhe claims under duress --in order to recover client files and computers and related equipment, \nwhich plaintiffs had taken on October 21, 2023. (RT 3/5/25, p. 110: 10-1 l 6:6, Exhs. 1694 and \n15558.) Norris explained that these files belonged to clients who had never been represented by \nBrown; Norris needed to obtain these files to contact them and to represent them. (id.) Despite \nsigning the agreement, plaintiffs never returned the client files to Norris, nor did they return \nPak's computer, which had a lot of information on it which was not maintained on any of their \nother computers. Due to the actions of the Browns and their counsel, it was impossible for the \nNorris firm to contact their clients, or to access critical information, such as their birth \ncertificates and medical files. (Id., at pp.116:7- 117:23.) Norris refused to have the records \nscanned by plaintiff' s counsel because, he explained, it would have meant that attorney client \ncommunications and client document s were being viewed and retained by someone other than \ntheir counsel. (Id., at 117:24-119: 1.) \nIV. PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS \nA. Claims Against Taurin Robinson \nThere is no evidentiary basis for holding Robinson liable under any theory advanced \nin the complaint. The record is devoid of any proof that Robinson engaged in fraud, \nmisconduct or breached any fiduciary duty. At the time of the relevant events, Robinson \nwas a law student and junior employee who acted solely under the direction of Brown, \nNorris and Pak. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 88:13-89:4.) He had no decision-making \nauthority , no control over client funds or firm assets, and received no financial benefit from the \nalleged conduct. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 93:27-95:1.) Robinson never received any \n8 Notably, the suite of offices still only said \"Law Offices of Baird Brown\" as of October 21, \n2023. (3/13/25, pp. 119, 21-28.) The Norris Law Firm was never identified on the suite's outer \ndoors. \n19 "}, {"page": 20, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 settlement funds or other compens ation despite his salary. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 93:27-\n95: l.) Brown testified that only he and Pak had access to the firm's bank accounts. (RT \n1/28/25, Brown, cross, 18:9-19:2.) \nWhen initially asked what Robinson did wrong, Brown responded that Robinson \nhad facilitated transfers of money from the Brown Law bank accounts. (RT 1/28/25, Brown, \ncross, 27:5-10.) However, when confronted with his earlier testimony that only he and Pak \nhad account access, Brown conceded , \"[t]hat's a fair point. Maybe he didn't.\" (RT 1/28/25, \nBrown, cross, 27: 11-28:4.) When asked whether Robinson did anything else wrong, Brown \nadmitted , \"[n]othing else comes to mind.\" (RT 1/28/25, Brown, cross, 28:5-7.) \nB. Claims Against Donald G. Norris and Donald G. Norris, A Law Corporation \nThe court prefaces its findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the claims \nbrought against Norris and his law corporation with the critical finding that Brown practiced \nalone prior to his suspension and thereafter. Brown never had a partner, associate , or \"of \ncounsel\" attorney associated with his firm to assist him with the practice of law. (RT 1/23/25 at \np. 34:2-14.) He admitted that when he was sick with Covid for an extended period in 2022, there \nwas no attorney handling any of his cases to his knowledge and he was not bringing in any new \ncases. His wife confirmed this. When asked how he was paying his staff, he stated that he did \nnot recall. (Id., at p. 34: 15-36: 16.) He did have various paralegals working for him, all non­\nattomeys, and an office manager, defendant Michelle Pak, who was actively engaged in helping \nhim attract clients and run his law practice. Neither Pak nor the various legal assistants could \nlegally practice law or handle legal matters without Brown's active participation and supervision. \nThus, for the three months that he was suspended, no work could take place on any of these cases \nwithout some lawyer other than Brown being responsible for the work. According to Brown, he \ndid not arrange to hire an attorney or associate in an attorney to handle the work during his \nsuspension; he simply sent notices to clients to let them know there were two attorneys they \ncould call if they had a concern: Norris and another contract attorney named Davis. \nIn addition, Brown and his counsel provided no explanation as to what lawyer was handling \nhis practice when he had back surgery and a long recovery at the end of 2019 and early 2020; \nwho handled it during his suspension in 2020 and who handled it when he was on a ventilator, \nhospitalized or in rehab through much of 2022. Either Brown agreed to have Norris take over \nthe practice, as Norris testified, or Brown was planning to have non-lawyers run his practice, \nwhich would be illegal. The court finds it more likely than not that Brown accepted that he \nneeded to transfer his cases to another attorney, here Norris, due to his declining health. Further, \nthe court finds it more likely than not that due to his many health issues and cognitive decline, \nwhen he looked back into the affairs of his office in 2023 (after nearly three years of inaction on \nhis part), he had forgotten that he had agreed to the transfer. The court believes that in 2023 and \nthereafter he was truly bewildered about what had transpired. Having not shared any of this \ninformation with his wife, she justifiabl y was concerned that Pak and Norris had colluded to \npush her husband out. \nIndeed, Brown admitted that after his suspension concluded at the end of June 2020, \nwhatever work he did on his cases thereafter was \"fairly minor.\" (RT 1/23/25 p. 46:24-28.) He \ncould not recall at the time of trial any work he had done on any case, or whether he had even \ngone to court on a case. (Id., at p. 47:1-28.) Notably, no evidence was presented by plaintiffs' \n20 "}, {"page": 21, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 team to show that he had in fact performed legal work on a single case after his suspension on \nApril 1, 2020. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 54:21-62:10.) \nAlso very telling is Brown's agreement with Norris on the Androgel case. The parties \nsigned a written agreement, which Brown did not dispute, giving Norris 20% of the fees to be \nrecovered on these cases. Not only does this completely bely Brown's claim that he had no \nmeetings or agreement with Norris in the 2019 period, but it also supports defendants ' contention \nthat Brown understood he needed help and needed to transfer his cases to a new lawyer; why \nwould a healthy active attorney who had performed considerable work on lucrative mass tort \nlitigation give 20% of the future recovery to an attorney he did not know, who would do nothing \non the case? \nBrown admitted that he did represent Norris in a legal malpractice case brought against I \nBrown and Norris relating to a case referred to as the \"Mick case.\" (RT 1/22/25 p. 128:6-132: \n4.) He admitted to filing an answer on behalf of himself and Norris in December 2020. (1/27/25 \nam, p. 72:6 -76:2, and Exh. 15534.) He claims that Norris was unhelpful in providing him with \ninformation and that he had no idea Norris had any involvement in the Mick litigation. (Id.) The \ncourt finds this hard to believe given that Brown admitted that he undertook to represent both of \nthem when the Mick family filed suit against them for missing the statute of limitation s. The \ncourt questions why Brown would represent Norris unless he thought Norris was working on the \ncase either as his associate or co-counsel. Brown never explained why he would represent Norris \nif he had no relationship with Norris or knowledge that Norris had assumed responsibility for \nany of his cases. \nBrown also admitted on cross-examination that in the 2020 period, he received emails from \nthe Law Offices of Don Norris, attaching draft notices of letters to send to clients. One of those \nletters informed clients that Brown had been suspended from practice; the other advised that \nBrown would be \"stepping away from [the] case\" and advising them that Norris would be \ncontacting them to discuss transfer of the case to Norris. (Exh. 15505.) Even though these were \nnot the ultimate notices sent to clients, they do show that Norris and Brown were in email \ndiscussion s about how best to inform clients of Brown's suspension and to transition the work to \nNorris. (RT 1/23/25 p. 43:3 -45:23.) Brown did not deny that he had received these emails. In \naddition, the court received into evidence text messages between Pak and Brown from the June \n2020 period where they discussed transferring cases to and from the Norris office. (RT 1/28/25 \np. 31 :2-38:6 and Exh. 1573, pp. 6-8.) \nBrown admitted that he continued to have access to his bank accounts (business and client \ntrust accounts) in 2019 and 2020. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 51: 2-24.) When shown his business bank \naccount statements for 2020 and 202 I, which showed a precipitou s reduction in revenue, he \nconceded that he had access to these accounts but does not recall there being a reduction of \nincome. (RT 1/28/25 at pp. 18:5 -22:8.) The court concludes from these records that either \nBrown did not bother to look at them because he was utterly disengaged from his practice, or he \nlooked at them and was not bothered by what he saw, because he knew that his law practice had \nbeen effectively transferred to Norris, thereby necessarily reducing his income. \nIndeed, had Brown been actively engaged in any of his federal mass tort cases, he would \nhave seen that substitutions of counsel had been filed in each of them, replacing his name as \ncounsel of record with that of Donald Norris. The execution of substitutions of attorney further \n21 "}, {"page": 22, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 confirms that Norris assumed representation of Brown's former clients with no objection raised. \n(Def. Exs. 15555, 1692; Pl. Exs. 1653-1655.) Again, either Brown knew and consented to these \nsubstitutions or he was not monitoring his federal practice for over three years. The court finds \nit is more lik~ly than not that he consented to these substitutions; not that he engaged in \ndeliberate malpractice or unethical conduct. \nFinally, the email exchange between Brown and Pak in June 2023, the questions posed by \nBrown to Granillo in June 2023, and the series of text messages spanning March 26, 2020 to \nJune 2023 (Exh. 1573) strongly support the court's conclusion that Brown was not doing \nanything to actively supervise and manage his cases after he was first suspended on April 1, \n2020, but rather understood that the law practice was being run by Norris. (RT 3/4/25, pp. 49-\n50.) That Brown had no idea what the status of his various cases was in June 2023 means he had \nnot been supervising them or moving them forward. Had he attempted to take any action on \nbehalf of any of his cases in the period between April 1, 2020 and June 2023, he would have \nrealized that he had been substituted out in early 2020 and that another attorney, Donald Norris, \nhad been handling many of these matters. \nJ. Claim for Theft and Conversion Against Norris and Norris Law Corporation -(Cal. \nPenal Code§ 496(c)) \nConversion requires that Plaintiffs prove ownership or a right to possess specific \nproperty, that Defendant s substantially interfered with that property through unauthorized \nconduct, and that Plaintiffs were harmed as a result. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General \nCorp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97.) \nPlaintiffs did not establish that the Norris defendant s took or retained plaintiffs' property. \nPlaintiffs failed to prove that Norris wrongfully obtained any clients or retained funds received in \nsettlement for those clients which rightfully belonged to plaintiffs. The court finds that Brown \nvoluntarily transferred the contested cases to Norris, commencing in 2019, because of his desire \nto wind down his practice and withdraw from the active practice of law given his significant \nhealth issues, and later, his suspension by the state bar. While Brown's cognitive function was \nprofoundly impaired at trial (and was significantly impaired as early as January 2022 when he \nnearly died from Covid), all witnesses agreed that Brown was functioning well enough in 2019 \nand 2020 to understand that he was voluntarily transferring his cases to Norris, to cooperate in \nthat process, and to negotiate many aspects of it. Anyone dealing with him during that process, \nincluding but not limited to Pak and Norris, would reasonably have believed that he had full \ncapacity to make the decision to wind down his practice and transfer his cases. The court \nconcludes that any deceptive practices which were instituted -and there were misstatements \nmade to clients to grease the wheels of moving clients to a new law firm -were conceived and \nexecuted by Pak. The court finds that Norris had no knowledge of the communication s being \nsent to clients and did not conspire or assist Pak or the other legal assistants at the firm to send \nany of those misleading communications. While the court disapproves of the wording of the \ncommunicati ons, that conduct does not constitute theft or conversion , since the evidence \noverwhelmingly supports the finding that Brown agreed to transfer these cases to Norris. If the \nmeans used were deceptive in any way, that does not transform the transfer itself into actionable \ntheft or conversion. The deceived parties, if any, were the clients, not Baird Brown. \nIn their closing brief, plaintiffs did not advance any argument that the Norris defendant s \n22 "}, {"page": 23, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 had taken or converted personal property in the sujte of offices out of which Norris and Pak \nworked. In any event, there was no specific evidence presented as to any particular items of \npersonal property which were converted; thus, any such claim would fail as well. \n2. Jnterferellce with contractual relations between Brown Law Firm and its clients. \nFor the same reasons discussed above, the court finds that plaintiffs have failed to \nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant s wrongfully interfered with the \nagreements between the Brown Law Firm and its clients. Baird Brown voluntarily decided to \nwithdraw from representation on the cases at issue here, to substitute the Norris Firm as counsel \non those cases and to transfer any cases which were just at their outset to the new firm. Thus, \nthere could be no interference with relations, since Baird Brown himself had decided to \nterminate those relationships. \n3. Unfair Business Practices \nPlaintiffs contend that defendant s engaged in unfair competition, both at common law \nand in violation of Business & Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq., by 1) Using fraud and deceit \nto steal Brown Law clients; 2) Appropriating the services of staff personnel on Brown Law's \npayroll; 3) Appropriating use of Brown Law's exclusive offices, Suite 980; 4) Using \nBrownLaw 's address and phone number for the Norris/Pak Firm; 5) Incorporating a headshot \nand the professional background of Brown into the new website for the Norris/Pak Firm \n(dnorrislaw.com); and 6) Passing off Norris as being closely associated with Brown Law. \nAs stated above, there was insufficient evidence presented to support a claim for unfair \ncompetition based on alleged theft of Brown Law clients. The court also finds that there was \ninsufficient evidence that the Norris firm appropriated the services of staff personnel, used the \nBrown law office suite, or used the Brown Law Firm address and phone number. The court finds \nthat Brown gave permission to Pak and Norris to use his staff, office suite, and office phone, at \nthe same time that Brown required Pak to use the suite and staff to finish up his remaining cases. \nBrown had access to the financial books, the office, the case files (through SugarSync) , and the \ncourt records (through Pacer and other means), which would have clearly revealed to him that \nwork was being done out of the suite by Norris and Pak, starting as early as his suspension in \nApril 2020. The court concludes that Brown accepted this arrangement. To the extent that \nBrown believes and now claims that office expenses , staff time, and rent should have been paid \nby the Norris office, either in whole or in some shared manner, no evidence was presented by \nplaintiffs to quantify any costs (payroll, rent or otherwise) that they paid, which should have \nbeen paid by the Norris firm, at least through October 21, 2023 There was no evidence that \nBrown continued to put any money into the firm after April 2020. Pak testified that she did put \nmoney into the business account or otherwise paid office expenses herself. Given this record, \nthe court finds plaintiffs have failed to establish unfair competition as a result of Norris and \nPak's use of the staff and the physical office, address and phone number through October 21, \n2023. \nHowever, plaintiffs did establish that Pak negotiated a reduction in the lease which \nincluded a balloon payment, which Brown has been left to pay, despite the fact that Pak and \nNorris benefited from the reduction in rent through the end of October 2023. As discussed \nfurther below, the court finds that plaintiffs have established that Pak breached her fiduciary du \n23 "}, {"page": 24, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 to Brown by negotiating a balloon payment, using the office suite for her ?ew business wi~h \nNorris and not paying her share of the balloon payment. There was no evidence that Norns \nparticipated in this breach or was even aware of it. \nWith respect to the claim that Norris violated Business & Professions Code Section \n17200 by using Brown's likeness on Norris's website, the court finds that the evidence is unclear \nwhether Brown's photo and bio was visible to the public and, if so, for how long. The court \nfinds credible Norris's testimony that he did not direct that Brown's image be used. The only \nevidence of Brown's image being visible to the public shows what appears to be a website under \nconstruction. Assuming, arguendo, that it was visible to people accessing Norris's website for \nsome uncertain period of time, the court finds that no damage has been established , nor can be \npresumed. Under the circumstances, plaintiffs have failed to prove that the website photo and bio \nconstitutes an unfair business practice. \nFinally, the court does find that it was deceptive advertising to describe Norris as an \nassociate of the law firm or his firm as a division of the Brown law firm in letters sent to the \nclients. The description might have misled clients to believe there was a long-standing \nrelationship between the two firms or attorneys, that Norris was in fact covered by Brown's \nmalpractice insurance , or that the two firms were one and the same. These letters should have \nbeen drafted in a way that did not create a false impression of a prior or existing relationship \nbetween the two firms. But these communications, while deceptive , did not cause any damage \nto the Brown law firm or deprive it of any money which could be restored, given that the court \nfinds that Brown approved the transfer of all of these cases to Norris. Further, the court finds \nthat Brown was actively running his office in 2019 and early 2020 and had full access to these \nletters that were being sent to clients. Thus, he would have approved these mailings, even if he \nno longer remembers that he did so. Plaintiffs have failed to establish any basis for recovery \nunder Section 17200. \nC. Claims Solely Against Pak -Breach of Fiduciary Duty \nJudge Recana determined that Pak owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs from 2015 to at least \nApril 1, 2020. (Order, 11/20/2024, pp. 6-7; emphasis added.) Brown confirmed that she held a \ntrusted position in his firm from at least 2015 through the spring of 2023. (1/23/25 at p. 22, ln 11 \nto 25, In. 8.) The court finds that Pak continued to owe Brown a fiduciary duty through October \n21, 2023, at least with respect to the handling of the cases and work she continued to manage for \nhim during that period. Pak did not persuade the court that all such work was completed by that \ntime. As such, he continued to require her undivided care and loyalty for the handling of those \ncases and management of his finances relating to those cases. Judge Recana set forth those \nduties: \n\"Every employee owes his or her employer duties of undivided care and loyalty.\" \n(Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs. (l 996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 74.) \"California law does \nnot authorize an employee to transfer his loyalty to a competitor. During the term \nof employment, an employer is entitled to its employees' 'undivided loyalty.\"' \n(Fowler v. Varian Assocs., (1987), 196 Cal.App.3d 34, 41 [finding a former \nmarketing manager owed a fiduciary duty to his former employer, which the manager \nbreached when he attempted to compete directly with his former employer) .) \n\"During the term of employment , an employer is entitled to its employees' \n24 "}, {"page": 25, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 'undivided loyalty.\"' (Stokes v. Dole Nut Co. (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 285, 295.) \n(Order, 11/20/2024, p. 6; emphasis added.) \nThose duties were further elaborated upon by the court of appeals in Huong Que, Inc. v. \nLuu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400: \nThe duty of loyalty embraces several subsidiary obligations, including the duty \"to \nrefrain from competing with the principal and from taking action on behalf of \nor otherwise assisting the principal' s competitors\" (Rest.3d, Agency,§ 8.04), the \nduty \"not to acquire a material benefit from a third party in connection with ... \nactions taken ... through the agent's use of the agent's position\" (id., § 8.02), and the \nduty \"not to use or communicate confidential information of the principal for \nthe agent's own purposes or those of a third party\" (id., § 8.05(2)). \n(Huong Que, Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400, 416.) \n1. Breach of fiduciary duty by Pak relating to alleged theft of clients \nPart of plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim against Pak rests on the unsupportable \nfactual contention that Pak used fraud and deceit to steal existing clients and potential new \nclients from Brown so that she could go into active competition with him when she was still \npurporting to work as his office manager. The court agrees that had Pak transferred Brown's \ncases, solicited the clients to switch fim1s, purchased new leads for Norris -all without Brown's \nknowledge and consent -she would clearly have breached her fiduciary duty to Brown. But the \nevidence does not support plaintiffs ' version of events. As discussed above, the court finds that \nBaird Brown voluntarily withdrew from many of his cases, encourag ed Pak to work with Norris \nto create a new mass tort practice for Norris's own firm, agreed to the substitution of Norris as \ncounsel of record on his existing cases, and consented to her using his office with Norris to \ncreate a new practice, while wrapping up Brown's few remaining personal injury cases. Having \nconsented to Pak playing this dual role, Brown cannot claim she breached a fiduciary duty to hi \nand his firm. \n2. Breach of fiduciary duty by Pak in the Use of Firm Money to Purchase Leads \nSeparately , plaintiffs contend that Pak breached her fiduciary duty to plaintiffs by using \nmoney in the Law Office's business money (BofA account #3119) to purchase $653,500 in \nleads in 2019. Those purchase s are as follows: \nMay 14, 2019 wire transfer of $195,000 to B Partners. (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 38.) \nMay 31, 2019 wire transfer of $48,500 to SMG (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 38) \nJune 3, 2019 transfer of $100,000 to SMG (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 48) \nAugust 19, 2019 transfer of $40,000 to OPL (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 64) \nOctober 21, 2019 transfer of $135,000 to B Partners (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 86.) \nOctober 22, 2019 transfer of$135,000 to B Partners (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 86.) \nThese are the transactions fairly presented in plaintiffs' closing brief and at trial. These \n28 are the only transactions which the court considers further as a result of the objections lodged b \n25 "}, {"page": 26, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 plajntiffs. \nThe court asked for further briefing from Pak's counsel to explain the source of these \nfunds and to respond to the objection s. The court finds Pak's explanation unhelpful in many \nrespects or not squared with the evidence presented. The court discusses each of these \ntransactions further below. \nIt is undisputed that Pak purchased leads from several firms at a total cost of $653,500 in \n2019 for use by the Norris firm. The evidence also showed that some of these funds originated \nin the Brown Client Trust Account, were transferred by Pak to the Brown Business Account \n(account ending 3119) and were then wired by Pak to third parties to purchase several tranches \nof client leads. The court finds that Pak had full authority and access to both of those accounts \npursuant to her agreement with Brown. The court also finds that Brown was writing checks from \nthe same two accounts in 2019 and so would have been aware of these transactions but made no \nobjection. The court finds that Brown knew that Pak was purchasing leads (because of the name \nof the payee) but did not know that she was purchasing leads for the Norris firm as opposed to \nthe Baird firm. Plaintiffs met their burden at trial of establishlng that some of these funds either \noriginated in the Baird Brown Client Trust Account or the business account, which would \nconstitute a breach of fiduciary duty if those funds were used for anything other than the benefit \nof the firm and/or Brown. Thus, the burden shifted to Pak to establish that these funds, in fact, \nbelonged to her to use as she elected. The court finds that Pak has not met that burden with \nrespect to all of these transactions. Moreover, Pak' s explanation for the source of these funds \nwas not credible in some respects. \nIn her response to plaintiffs' objections filed on November 3, 2025, Pak claims that the \ndisputed purchases of $635,500 in leads for the Norris firm \"were funded by Ms. Pak through a \ncombinatio n of direct contributions and assumed obligations: \n• $335,000 wired into BrownLaw' s account from Ms. Pak's personal funds (Ex. B, \nTrial Tr. 2/14/25 at 50: 15-28, 52:4-6) \n• $230,000 from a loan originally made to Mr. Brown by Carolina Navarro, which \nMs. Pak assumed (Ex. B, Trial Tr. 2/14/25 at 51 :5-58:10; Ex. C. 3/7/25 at \n123:6-13, 124:1-12) \n• $100,000 retained earnings credit established on February 26, 2019, when \nBrownLaw issued $215,000 to Mr. Brown and $115,000 to Ms. Pak's company, \nUSCV (Ex. B, Trial Tr. 2/14/25 at 53:1-2; TrEx 7, p. 13) \n(Response of Defendan t/Cross-complainant Pak to Plajntiffs' Objections to Court \nProposed Statement of Decision, p. 3.) As explained further below, these assertions do not \nestablish that all of these lead purchases were funded by Pak's own money or money she was \nowed under her profit-sharing agreement with Brown. \nThe first transaction that the Browns challenge as suspect was a $195,000 payment from \nthe Brown Business Account (3119) dated May 14, 2019 to purchase leads from a company \nreferred to as \"B Partners.\" The bank records show that this same amount was transferred by \nPak to account 3119 a day before from the BrownLaw client trust account. (Exh. 8, p. 27.) Th \nsame is true for the next purchase of leads made on May 31, 2019 in the amount of$48,500. \n(Exh. 7, p. 38.) The evidence shows this money was pajd out of the business account by Pak, \n26 "}, {"page": 27, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 following a deposit into the account from the client trust account by Pak. (Id .. ) Thus, by the end \nof May 2019, Pak had taken $243,500 out of the Client Trust Account to purchase leads for \nNorris. \nPak explained these expenditures as follows: She claims that as of May 14, she had an \nearnings credit of $100,000 in the Client Trust Account from February 2019 because in February \nBrownLaw had issued $215,000 to Brown and $115,000 to Pak's company USCV, shorting her \nby $100,000. She also presented evidence that she had a credit of $230,000 with BrownLaw \nbecause she had assumed a loan in that amount owed by a former client to Baird Brown. That \nevidence was not refuted and was corroborated by the client, Carolina Navarro. (3/7/2 Tr. \n136:20-26.) Moreover , Pak presented evidence that the court found credible that Brown was \nreviewing all of these transactions and raised no objections to them. As stated elsewhere in this \nopinion, Brown was competent in 2019 and handling his business affairs. Moreover, he knew \nthe leads were not being purchased for the Brown firm because he was stepping back from the \nfirm, transferring his clients to Norris and not intending to practice law in the future. He could \nnot have intended Pak to be purchasing hundreds of leads for his own firm, since he had no \nlawyer (other than Norris) associating in to handle these cases. \nNonetheless, Pak was responsible for managing the payments and the books and her \naccounting practices likely were confusing to Brown. Her testimony that she had an earned \nincome credit of $100,000 as of May 2019 was demonstrated to be false by the records submitted \nand the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Holstrom. Indeed, by May 14, 2019, Pak had already \ntransferred $40,000 (two checks of $20,000) to herself from the business account, reducing any \ncredit to $60,000. The evidence presented also showed that by October 14, 2019, she had \ntransferred another $75,000 to her company , without comparable payouts to Brown. (Ex.h. 7.) \nThus, the $100,000 credit was ephemeral. At best, plaintiffs admit Pak had a credit of $20,000 \nby the end of 2019. (See Brief, at p. 7, Ins. 11-15.) \nAccordingly, the court finds that Pak has presented adequate evidence that she had \n$230,000 in a credit, justifying her transfer of $230,000 of the $243,500 from the client trust \naccount in May 2019 to purchase leads. She has not adequately explained the additional $13,50 \nshe transferred in May. \nTurning to the June 3, 2019 wire transfer of $100,000 from the business account to \npurchase leads from SMG, plaintiffs failed to establish that this expenditure was improper. \nImmediately before this wire transfer out, Pak wired $200,000 of her own money into the \naccount. (Tr Ex.h. 7, p. 48.) Even if her testimony about this transfer was confusing at trial, tha \ntestimony did not make this transaction a breach of her fiduciary duty to Brown. The parties had \nan understanding, the court finds, that the business account could be used by Pak to conduct \nthese types of transactions, even if not for the immediate benefit of Brown or the BrownLaw \nfirm. Thus, the $100,000 spent on June 3 is adequate ly accounted for by Pak and does not \nconstitute a breach of her fiduciary duty to plaintiffs. But the court agrees with Plaintiffs that \nPak then transferred $100,000 out of the account for her own purposes, leaving no excess to \ncover the other transactions discussed below. \nWith respect to the August 19, 2019 transfer of $40,000 to OPL, Pak has not presented \ncredible evidence that she had a credit or other money available to her in the Client Trust \nAccount, which would cover this payment to OPL. Therefore, plaintiffs have established that \n27 "}, {"page": 28, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Pak breached her fiduciary duty by transferring funds from the client trust account to cover this \nlead purchase . \nWith respect to the two $135,000 purchases ofleads from B Partners made on October 21 \nand 22, 2019 out of the business account, $135,000 was transferred by Pak from the Client Trust \nAccount into account 3119 to make these purchases and $135,000 came from plaintiffs own I \nmoney. (See Exh. 8, p. 55 and Exh. 7, p. 86.) Pak was not able to present any credible evide~ce \nas to why she was entitled to $135,000 of the client trust account money as her own at that pomt \nin time. Accordingly, plaintiffs have established that she breached her fiduciary duty to Baird \nBrown when she used client trust account funds to purchase $135,000 in leads in October 2019. \nIn sum, the court agrees with plaintiffs that they have established that Pak breached her \nfiduciary duty to plaintiffs by using $188,500 of money belonging to the firm and/or Brown to \npurchase leads for the Norris firm. \nTo the extent that plaintiffs claim Pak breached her fiduciary duty to the law firm in her \nhandling of the cases which Brown retained after April 1, 2020, insufficient evidence was \npresented to support such claim. The evidence showed that Brown entrusted Pak, a non-lawyer \nwith limited English skills and no discernible professional credentials, to finish up certain \npersonal injury cases. No evidence was presented to credibly establish that she did not \ndischarge her duty, attempt to complete those cases, negotiate liens, or obtain funds owed to the \nBrown Law Firm. As previously stated, Brown's delegation of these duties, many of which \nwould almost certainly have involved legal work, or negotiations with a client and third parties \non behalf of a client, to a person of Pak's minimal qualification s, showed poor judgment, perhap \nexplainable by his health issues and deteriorating cognitive abilities. Nonetheless, there was no \nevidence of actual breach by Pak as it related to these retained personal injury cases, or damages \ncaused by such a breach. \n3. Breach of fiduciary duty by Pak relating to payment of rent \nThe court also finds Pak breached her fiduciary duty to Brown in her handling of the \nrental agreement. While the court finds that it is more likely than not that Brown permitted Pak \nto continue to use the office suite for her work with the Norris firm, given that she would be \nworking in the suite to complete his cases as well, Pak was not transparent in her handling of the \nrental agreement or the lease payments , as she was required as Brown's fiduciary. Plaintiffs did \nnot provide persuasive evidence that the rental payments, however, were being paid with \nBrown's money, as opposed to Pak's money, for the period after 2020. They did establish that \nbalance is owed of $64,425, as of February 29, 2024. Subtracting from that amount four months \nof rent for the period November 2023 to February 29, 2024 (when Pak and Brown were barred \nfrom the offices), at an average base rent of $4000, leaves a \"balloon\" payment of $48,000. P \nbreached her fiduciary duty to Brown by failing to pay one half of this amount, since her \nbusiness was utilizing at least one half of the office space. Accordingly, plaintiffs Brown and \nBrown, A professional Law Corporation , are entitled to damages in the amount of $24,000 base \non this breach. \n4. Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Pak relating to the Roh Case \nPlaintiffs failed to present persuasive evidence that Pak's conduct with respect to the Roh \n28 "}, {"page": 29, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 case violated her fiduciary duty to Brown. As stated throughout the opinion, the court finds that \nBrown acquiesced in the transfer of his cases to the Norris firm because_ ~f his heal~ issues~ ~he \nstate bar investigation and his understanding that he did not have the ability to contmue to litigate \nthese cases. There was no evidence that Pak used undue influence on the Roh family or that \nBrown was unaware of the transfer. If Brown truly believed he was still representing Roh, he \nwould have exercised his professional obligations to keep abreast of the case and would have \nimmediately seen that a substitution had been filed, replacing his office with the Norris law firm. \nHad Brown believed that he was still responsible for the case, he would have known that \nsettlement and litigation activity was taking place without him. The fact that he did nothing is \nirrefutable evidence that he consented to the substitution. There can be no breach of a fiduciary \nduty where the party to whom the duty is owed consents to the conduct about which he later \ncomplains. \nD. Elder Financial Abuse Against All Defendants (Cal. Welfare & Inst. Code§ 15600 et \nseq.) \nUnder Welfare and Institution s Code section 15610.30 , to establish elder abuse, Plaintiffs \nwere required to prove that Defendant s took, appropriated, obtained, or retained property for a \nwrongful use or with the intent to defraud or by undue influence, that Mr. Brown was 65 years or \nolder at the time, and that Defendants' conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm. \nPlaintiffs failed to prove that Norris or Pak wrongfully obtained any clients or retained funds \nreceived in settlement for those clients which rightfully belonged to plaintiffs. The court finds \nthat Baird Brown willingly transferred the contested cases to Norris, commencing in 2019, \nbecause of his desire to wind down his practice and withdraw from the active practice of law \ngiven his significant health issues, and later, his suspension by the state bar. While Brown's \ncognitive function was profoundly impaired at trial and the court finds, was significantly \nimpaired as early as January 2022 when he nearly died from Covid, he was functioning well \nenough in 2019 and 2020 to understarid that he was voluntarily transferring his cases to Norris, \nto cooperate in that process, and to negotiate many aspects of it. \nAs discussed above, trial testimony from Dr. Lombard and Ann Brown confirmed that \nBrown maintained sufficient cognitive ability to understand the transition of his practice in 2020. \n(RT 1/22/25, 84:9-85:9, 88: 10-11, 87: 16-88:28; 3/13/25, 129: 17-131 :20.) Brown executed a \ndeclaration pursuant to Rule 9.20 confirming his notification of clients, and Substitution of \nAttorney forms were properly processed and filed. (Def. Exs. 15503, 15508, 15555; Pl. Exs. \n1653-1655.) The evidence demonstrates a consensual transfer. Additionally, witness Rhonda \nLewis confirmed that Brown told clients directly in 2019 that he was retiring and transferring \ntheir cases to Norris. (RT 3/14/25 PM, 16:25-27, 24:1-3; Def. Ex. 15565.) Similarly, Granillo \nand Robinson testified that Brown did not exhibit any mental decline during the 2019 to 2020 \nperiod when the cases were transferred. Anyone dealing with Brown during those years, \nincluding but not limited to Pak and Norris, would reasonably have believed that he had full \ncapacity to make the decision to wind down his practice and transfer his cases. \nAlthough plaintiffs failed to establish any conduct by the Norris defendants that would \namount to financial elder abuse, they did establish that Pa.k's conduct violated the act. \nAs stated above, the court finds that Pak breached her fiduciary duty to Brown in her \n28 handling of the rental payments and in her use of firm funds to purchase leads in 2019 for the \n29 "}, {"page": 30, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n1 1 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Norris firm in the amount of $188,500. Elder financial abuse under Welfare and Institutions \nCode Section 15600, et seq. includes the wrongful taJ<ing of \"real or personal property of an \nelder by undue influence as defined in Section 15610.70.\" Section 15610.30(b) provides that \"A \nperson or entity shall be deemed to have taken, secreted, appropriated , obtained, or retained \nproperty for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person or entity takes, secretes, \nappropriates, obtains, or retains the property and the person or entity knew or should have known \nthat this conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder or dependent adult.\" \nPlaintiff established that Pak's breach of her fiduciary duty to Brown constitutes financial \nelder abuse within the meaning of the statute. The court notes that plaintiffs did not establish \nthat Norris participated in the wrongful taking, or that he knew the source of the money used to \npurchase leads or understood that Pak was using Brown's money to pay the lease for his office. \nThus, Norris is not liable under the Elder Abuse statute. \nBecause plaintiffs established by a preponderance of the evidence that Pak engaged in \nconduct which amounts to elder financial abuse, \"as defined in Section 15610.30, in addition to \ncompensatory damages and all other remedies otherwise provided by law, the court shall award \nto the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\"(§ 15657.5, subd. (a), italics added.) \"The \nattorney fee provision in section 15657.5 is not discretionary in nature.\" (Arace v. Medico \nInvestments, LLC. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 977, 983.) Pak is also potentially liable for treble \ndamages under Civil Code Section 3345 (discussed below). \nE. Conspiracy \nBecause the court finds that Brown approved of and participated in the transfer of clients \nto the Norris Law firm, as well as all the steps to effectuate the transfer -substitution of counsel, \nletters to clients, new retainer agreements -and that plaintiffs have failed to prove any of the \nclaims, the conspiracy claims also necessarily fail. There was also no evidence presented that \nNorris or Robinson conspired with Pak to breach her fiduciary duties by delaying the payment o \nrent or using BrownLaw funds to purchase leads for the Norris firm. \nF. Punitive Damages \nPlaintiffs failed to prove that any of the defendants acted with malice, fraud or oppression \ntowards plaintiffs. With respect to the claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Pak for her non \npayment of rent and use of firm funds, the court does not find clear and convincing evidence tha \nsuch conduct was done with malice, fraud or oppression. At most, Pak was negligent in her \ndischarge of her fiduciary duties with respect to the payment of rent. With respect to the use of \nfirm funds, the court finds that Pak did not conceal the use of these funds and may have believed \nthat these were merely advances that would later be evened out by subsequent distributions. In \nany event, her conduct was not malicious, oppressive or fraudulent within the meaning of the \nstatutory scheme. \nG. Enhanced Damages under Civil Code Section 3345 \nPlaintiffs seek enhanced damages under Civil Code Section 3345, which provides for \nadditional penalties where unfair or deceptive practices have been used against senior citizens. \nThat section provides in pertinent part: \n30 "}, {"page": 31, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 (b) Whenever a trier of fact is authorized by a statute to impose either a fine, \nor a civil penalty or other penalty, or any other remedy the purpose or effect of \nwhich is to punish or deter, and the amount of the fine, penalty, or other remedy is \nsubject to the trier of fact's discretion, the trier of fact shall consider the factors set \nforth in paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive, in addition to other appropriat e factors, in \ndetermining the amount of fine, civil penalty or other penalty, or other remedy to \nimpose. Whenever the trier of fact makes an affirmative finding in regard to one \nor more of the factors set forth in paragraph s (1) to (3), inclusive, it may impose a \nfine, civil penalty or other penalty, or other remedy in an amount up to three times \ngreater than authorized by the statute, or, where the statute does not authorize a \nspecific amount, up to three times greater than the amount the trier of fact would \nimpose in the absence of that affirmative finding. \n( 1) Whether the defendant knew or should have known that their conduct was \ndirected to one or more senior citizens, disabled persons, or veterans. \n(2) Whether the defendant's conduct caused one or more senior citizens, \ndisabled persons, or veterans to suffer: loss or encumbrance of a primary \nresidence, principal employment, or source of income; substantial loss of property \nset aside for retirement, or for personal or family care and maintenance; or \nsubstantial loss of payments received under a pension or retirement plan or a \ngovernment benefits program, or assets essential to the health or welfare of the \nsenior citizen, disabled person, or veteran. \n(3) Whether one or more senior citizens, disabled persons, or veterans are \nsubstantially more vulnerable than other members of the public to the defendant's \nconduct because of age, poor health or infirmity, impaired understanding , \nrestricted mobility, or disability, and actually suffered substantial physical, \nemotional , or economic damage resulting from the defendant's conduct. \nWhile the language of the statute is broad, on its face it only allows for treble damages where \nthe trier of fact has imposed a fine, civil penalty or other penalty to deter conduct. (Clark v. \nSuperior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 605. 614 (\"trebled recovery may be awarded under Civil Code \nsection 3345, subdivision (b) only if the statute under which recovery is sought permits a remedy \nthat is in the nature of a penalty\"). Because the court has declined to award any punitive \ndamages and no statutory penalty is available under the Elder Abuse Act, the court cannot award \nany enhancement under Section 3345. \nH. Quantum Meruit \nPlaintiff presented Carole Buckner as an expert witness on some of the legal ethics issues \npresented in this case. Buckner has extensive experience as an expert in the field of legal ethics \nand was accepted by the court as an expert in the field. (RT 3/4/25, at p. 16-21.) \nBuckner opined that an attorney who has notice of a lien in favor of prior counsel on the case \nis obligated under California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15 to notify all effected parties of \nthe lien and to retain the funds in the attorney's client trust account if there is a dispute about \ndisbursement of such funds. (Id., at p. 22: 1-23:28.) She testified that the mere fact that an \nattorney had been suspended does not nullify a lien held by the attorney's law firm. (Id., at p. \n31 "}, {"page": 32, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 25-26.) Moreover, she testified that there is a distinction between an attorney being suspended \nfrom the practice of law and an attorney withdrawing from representing a client. Suspension \ndoes not automatically mean that the attorney must withdraw. (Id., at p. 38:27-39:23.) \nOn these same lines, Bucker explained that there is no California case deciding whether an \nattorney who has been suspended from the practice of law is entitled to fees earned prior to that \nsuspension. (Id., at p. 40: 1-14.) Decisions from other jurisdiction s, except for Texas, allow an \nattorney to obtain fees for work performed prior to a suspension. (Id., at p. 44: 1-14.) \nBuckner also expressed the opinion that it is permissible under Rule of Professional Conduct \n5.4 for a non-lawyer such as Pak to enter into an agreement with a law firm by which the non­\nlawyer receives a percentage of the profits or net revenue. She qualified this, however, by stating \nthat it is impermissible for a non-lawy er to receive a percentage of an attorney fee award or \npayment of fees on a specific case or specific legal matters. (Id., at p. 37:3 -38: 15.) Reviewing \nthe agreement signed by Pak in July 2019 (but not Norris), Buckner opined that this arrangement \n(90% of net profits of the mass tort practice) would violate Rule 5.4 since it relates to specific \ncases (the mass tort practice). (Id.) \nUltimately, much of Buckner's opinion was irrelevant. While the court would agree that \nmere suspension for a three month period does not equate with an automatic withdraw al from \nrepresentation or nullify attorney fees earned in the period before the suspension, as explained \nelsewhere in this opinion the court concludes that Brown agreed to withdraw from most of his \ncase, including all the mass tort cases, and to transfer most of his open cases to the Norris law \nfirm. Thus, the court is presented with the question whether Brown is entitled to a share of the \nfees on cases where he voluntarily withdrew from representing the client. \nOn this issue, Norris presented the testimony of Joel Osman, who the court accepted as an \nexpert on legal ethics generally, and more specifically on the issue of quantum meruit recovery \nin this case. (RT 3/13/25, p. 7: 13-11: 10.) Osman explained that under the rules of professional \nconduct, an attorney may withdraw, but if they do so voluntarily, they are not entitled to recover \nfor work done prior to their withdrawa l, even under a quantum meruit theory. In so opining, \nOsman relied on the Falco case, which was also supported by a more recent case out of the \nUnited States Bankruptc y Court, In re Michael David Paris, 568 B.R. 810 (U.S. Bankruptcy Ct. \nC.D. Cal. 2017). (Id., at pp. 11 :1-21:25.) \nThe general rule in California is that \"an attorney who withdraws voluntarily without cause \nforfeits recovery for services performed.\" (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1015.) \nThe courts have grappled with what constitutes \"good cause,\" and have agreed that withdrawal \ndue to ethical concerns about the client's behavior (not present here) would constitute good \ncause. (Id.) This court could not find any California case to discuss whether ill health \nconstitutes good cause to withdraw. \nIf the facts of this case were that Brown was too ill to continue to represent the clients at \nissue here, and that there were no other factors present, the court might well conclude that Brown \nwas entitled to fees under a quantum meruit theory. However, the court finds that Brown \nwithdrew because he wanted to retire, he was facing a state bar investigation and he ultimately \nwas suspended for several months. By his own admission and the testimony of his wife and \ndoctor, Brown was not too ill to continue to handle these cases in 2019 and 2020, had he chosen \n32 "}, {"page": 33, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 to do so. Instead, this was a voluntary withdrawal on his part without justifiable cause. \nMoreover, the situation is complicated by the fact that Brown now denies that he withdrew, so he \nis not even advancing any of these bases as legitimate grounds to withdraw or properly invoking \na claim for damages urider quantum meruit. Finally, Brown has not presented any evidence to \nquantify the amount of work he did on the disputed cases prior to their transfer to Norris. \nThe court concludes that where there is a voluntary withdrawal from representation without \nsubstantial justification , the withdrawing counsel is not entitled to fees under a quantum meruit \ntheory, unless the client and new counsel agree. Here there was no agreement between Brown \nand Norris for Brown to retain any right to fees and certainly there was no evidence of clients \nbeing informed of a fee split. Accordingly, Brown is not entitled to recover any of the attorney \nfees earned on the mass tort cases transferred to Norris under a quantum meruit theory, even for \nwork he may have performed prior to April 1, 2020. \nD. Pak's Counter-Claims \nMichelle Pak seeks damages against Baird and Ann Brown and against Andrew and Jonathan \nWhite for damages she suffered as a result of an alleged assault and battery committed by the \nWhites during their entry into the law offices on October 21, 2023. The elements of a battery \nclaim are that the defendant touched plaintiff with the intent to harm or offend her; that the \nplaintiff did not consent; that the plaintiff did not consent to the touching, that plaintiff was \nharmed or offended by defendant s conduct, and that a reasonable person in plaintiffs situation \nwould have been offended by the touching. (CACI 1300.) Pak claims she suffered physical \ninjuries as well as severe emotional distress and seeks damages of $250,000, plus punitive \ndamages against each of the cross-defendants. \nIn weighing Pak's counter-claims, the court finds Pak to lack credibility as a witness. In \naddition to her constantly shifting and evasive testimony, Pak admitted that she had given false \ntestimony in her deposition about her pay arrangement with the Norris law firm. (RT 1/27/25 p. \n18:6-21.) She conceded she was not just paid$ I 00,000 a year or under $30 per hour, but \n\"multiple millions of dollars\" over her tenure with the Norris Law firm. (Id.) She testified \nfalsely that she had not made payments out of the Baird Brown Operating Expense Account in \n2021, 2020 and 2023, when the court easily found her signature on checks written on that \naccount for rent and other items. (RT 1/27/25, p. 58:1-28 and exhibits 7-15.) Indeed, the court \nfinds her testimony entirely untrustworthy. \nReviewing the evidence presented by plaintiff in support of her counter-claims, Pak testified \nthat she was given no advance notice that Brown would be coming to the office on October 21, \n2023. (2/10/25 RT at p. 11: 19-27.) She was called into the office that day, a Saturday, by \nmanagement for the building, who reported to her that people were in the office. She testified \nthat both Browns were present, as well as Jonathan and Andrew White, as well as a person who \nwas either a security guard or police. She was threatened multiple times that day by Andrew \nWhite that she would be arrested if she did not leave. \nThe key video here is Exhibit 15552, which is one of many showing a long standoff between \nPak and Andrew White, who was purportin g to terminate her as office manager for Baird Brown \nand requesting that she leave the office. Pak indicated that she wanted to be able to take her \nown checkbook, although she was unclear and evasive about what she wanted to take. The \n33 "}, {"page": 34, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nI I \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 video, taken by Jonathan White, shows Pak squatting to unlock a file cabinet with Andrew White \nhovering over her and then pulling out a large check book. Andrew White demanded to see it \nand looked inside. When he noted that it belonged to Donald Norris, he snatched it from her and \nsaid she could not take it. He then roughly shut the drawer, pushing her back as he did so. In the \nprocess, Ms. Pak fell backward s a few inches onto her buttocks, and it appears that her hand was \nclipped by the drawer as it was shut. Andrew White did come in contact with Ms. Pak when he \npushed the drawer shut, though he did not strike or kick her. When Andrew White proceeded to \nwalk away, Pak leapt up and rushed after him. She can be seen pursuing him into the hall and \ngrabbing at him, at which point the video goes black. She claims that it was after the video was \nturned off that both of the Whites pushed her into a corner of the public hallway and hit her in \nthe head and kicked her with their feet and hit her in the chest, hands and face, \"continuously\" \nstriking her. (RT /10/25, atpp. 17:12-18:15.) \nPak testified that her hand was injured when both of the Browns grabbed her and tried to \ngrab her checkbook and twisted her hand and wrist when she was outside of the office. This \ntestimony is inconsistent with the video which shows that the checkbook was in Andrew \nBrown's hand when he exited the office. Pak would have had to wrestle it away from him for it \nto be in her hands. She also testified that her right hand was injured when it was slammed in the \ndrawer of the file cabinet and claims that Exhibit 15514 shows injuries of her right hand. \nAlthough it appears the door clipped her hand, (as she made a brief intake of breath), she \nimmediatel y used that same hand to grab a box, use her keys, push herself up from the floor and \ngrab at Mr. Brown in the hallway. None of her fingernails were damaged in this alleged injury \nto her hand. She also did not appear to suffer any injury to her legs while still in the office and \nwalked after Mr. Brown aggressively even after she fell back on the floor. \nShe testified that after the incident, she was so afraid she could not leave the house. This \ntestimony was impeached by photographs showing that she went back to the office -the site of \nthe incident-the next day. (RT 2/10/25, at p. 27:15-28:26; RT 2/14/25, p. 127:10-129:20 and \nExh. 1680.) Mrs. Brown, who was present in the offices on October 21, 2023, and who the \ncourt found to be an entirely credible witness, testified that she did not see or hear anything to \nindicate the Pak had been assaulted or injured that day. (RT 3/13/25, p. 176.) \nAs stated above, the court finds Pak not to be a credible witness. She admitted to perjuring \nherself at least once and much of her testimony was evasive, incredibl e, or outright false. The \ncourt finds CACI 5003 particularl y instructive here, which advises the trier of fact \"that if it \ndecides that a witness did not tell the truth about something important , the trier of fact may \nchoose not to believe anything that witness said.\" The court does not find credible her \ndescription of what happened in the hallway after the ·video went black. The court does not \nbelieve that the Whites beat and kicked her as she testified. The court finds this testimony \nexaggerated and false. \nThe court does agree that the video shows that Andrew White came in contact with Pak as he \npushed the drawer closed, but that such conduct was not intentional and was not intended to \nharm or offend her. With respect to the threats to call the police and have her arrested, because \nshe was still an employee of the Brown Law Firm, still owed a fiduciary duty to the firm, and \nAnn Brown and the Whites reasonably believed that Pak was engaging in financial misconduct, \nthe Whites were within their rights when they told Pak that she could be arrested if she did not \nleave the premises. \n34 "}, {"page": 35, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Accordingly , the court finds in favor of Andrew White, Jonathan White, Baird Brown and \nAnn Brown on Pak's claims for assault and battery. \nAs for her remaining causes of action --1) Breach of Contract, 2) Money Had and Received, \n3) Open Book Account, 4) Account Stated, 5) Conversion, 6) Unauthorized Computer Access \n(violation of Penal Code §502), and 7) Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. --Pak \nfailed to establish all of the elements for any of these causes of action, entitling cross-defendants \nto judgment on these claims. \nE. Counter-Claims of Donald Norris and Donald Norris, a Law Corporation \nAs stated previously , in contrast to Pak, the court found Norris's testimony to be credible on \nmost points, even if evasive or overly cautious at times. The court did not find him to be \nexaggerating or downplaying negative facts. He satisfied the court that he was not aware of any \nmalfeasance of Pak towards Brown, that he reasonably trusted her representations about Brown' \ninvolvement and agreement with the transfer of clients, and that she was conducting the actual \ncommunicating with clients with Brown's consent and oversight. Perhaps he should have \nscrutinized every step of the process more carefully and obtained Brown's written consent to \neach step, but the court knows of no legal authority requiring that he do so. He justifiably relied \non representations made to him by Brown and by Brown's trusted office manager to accept that \nthese cases were being transferred to him to work up and complete, because Brown was \nwithdrawing from them as counsel because of his intent to retire. \n1. First Cause of Action -Conversion (Civ. Code§ 3336, CACI 2100) \nThe Norris cross-complainants contend that the cross-defendants unlawfully converted the \npersonal property of the Norris firm and its clients by seizing and retaining client files, \ncomputers, locked file cabinets, and critical law firm infrastructure, without notice, consent, or \nlegal process. This included physical hardware , digital data, and confidential documents \nbelonging solely to the Norris Law Firm. They contend they suffered substantial and \ndocumentable damages as a direct result of the unauthorized office takeover on October 21, 202 \nand their inability to gain access to their files. Specifically , they claim that they lost the costs o \nleads they had paid for in the amount of $605,074.8, as well as $120,011.38 in documented \nexpenses they were required to incur to reestablish their practice after being forcibly removed \nfrom their prior office. (Ex. 15562; RT 3/7/25, Norris Direct, 160:3-166:15) . \nCivil Code section 3336 states that \"[t]he detriment caused by the wrongful conversion of \npersonal property is presumed to be: [fl First-The value of the property at the time of the \nconversion , with the interest from that time, or, an amount sufficient to indemnify the party \ninjured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of the wrongful act \ncomplained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not have averted; and \n[1] Second-A fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the \nproperty. \" \nCross-complainant s established that on October 21, 2023, cross-defendants entered Suite 980 \nat 3055 Wilshire Blvd. There was nothing unlawful about this entry. At the time, Brown was th \nlawful tenant and leaseholder , and he maintained employee s, including Pak, working on his \nremaining cases. The court agrees that Norris also had a right to be on the premises as a co-\n35 "}, {"page": 36, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 tenant with the Brown Law Firm. While not formally approved by the landlord, the court finds \nthat the agreement between Brown and Norris was that Norris could also use the suite to conduct \nhis practice. (RT 2/28/25, p. 49-51.) \nOne of Norris's claims is that cross-defendants' actions on October 21, 2023 constituted a \n\"forced entry.\" Although this is not a separate cause of action, cross-defendants failed to \nestablish that the incidents on October 21, 2023 should be viewed as a \"forced entry.\" Brown \nand his agents had a lawful right to be on the premises, which were leased to Brown, bore his \nname on the outer doors as the only occupant, and for which he was paying some portion of the \nmonthly rent. \nThe undisputed evidence established that after entering the premises, cross-defendants took \npossession of everything in the suite, including certain files and other personal property \nbelonging to Norris and his law firm. According ly, the court finds that cross-complainants did \nestablish their claim that cross-defendants Baird Brown and Ann Brown collectively converted \ncertain of their personal property, in violation of Civil Code Section 3336. (See below for \ndiscussion of the liability of Andrew and Jonathan White for conversion. ) \nNorris testified that the cost ofreplacing lost office furniture was $50,000. (RT 3/5/25 p. \n120: 1-50.) The court found this testimony not credible, given that all evidence points to Norris \nmerely moving into and occupying an existing office suite paid for and furnished by the Brown \nLaw offices. No credible evidence was presented that the furnishings and office equipment in \nthose buildings was paid for by anyone other than the Brown Law Offices. As stated \npreviously , the court discounts Pak's testimony in this regard, as she was a thoroughly unreliable \nwitness. \nHowever , Norris testified credibly that his firm had to expend time and effort to try to rebuil \nthe files, contact clients, and reestablish a new office. Norris testified that it took his firm three to \nfour months to reconstruct their files and get their new office up and running. His staff was \nworking full time on this project, with a total monthly payroll cost of $20,204. (RT 3/7 /25 \npp.161-I 62.) Norris also explained that they had to incur additional costs to advertise their \nmove to the new suite of offices, or $8850. (Id., at pp. 163-165; and Exh. 15562.) These \ndamages are recoverab le, in the court's opinion, as money spent \"in pursuit\" of reconstructing \nthe personal property taken from them. \nThe court also found credible Norris's testimony that they had to purchase supplies, which \nmore likely than not, had been purchased by Pak and Norris over the prior three years and not by \nthe Brown Fim1, for an additional expense of $25,375, as well as computers , or $6241.75.910 The \n9 The court finds cross-defendants have not established that they are entitled to cost of parking, \ntelephone, insurance, or CCTV, since all of these costs would have been incurred in any event \neven if they had remained sharing the Brown Law suite of offices. \n10 An inordinate amount of time was spent at trial by Brown's attorneys trying to establish that \nseveral of the invoices presented for computers were falsified, including presentation of a \nforensic computer expert, Bruce Pixley. While the court found Pixley's testimony credible, it \ndid little to persuade the court that Pak or Norris had falsified the records or directed someone to \ndo that; the court finds it more likely that when Pak asked for back up invoices, the computer \n36 "}, {"page": 37, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 court found this testimony credible and persuasive on the issue of damages caused by plaintiffs ' \nseizure of their office supplies and computers. While Brown may have had the right to restrict \naccess to the suite, he excluded the Norris firm in a manner that was extremely disruptive to his \nlaw practice. Had the Brown firm simply requested Norris to leave within a reasonable time \nframe and to remove his office supplies, equipment and files, these expenses could have been \navoided. \nNorris did not establish that he was entitled to compensation for his office rental, as Norris \nwould always have had to pay at least $3000 for rent even if he had remained at the Brown suite \nof offices. Moreover , he did not present persuasive testimony that he had prepaid for the rent \nfor Suite 980 for the months of November , December and January, 2024, although he appears to \nbe claiming rent for those months as damages. The court is not persuaded that he even paid rent \nfor October 2023, given that the only evidence before the court of rent being paid by Norris was \n$15,000 at an earlier point in time. Pak also did not provide persuasive testimony that she \npersonally paid the rent for October 2023. \nWith respect to the central issue of the retention of client files, the court finds that cross­\ndefendants Baird and Ann Brown took possession of files which did not belong to them. The \ncourt further finds that Ann Brown made the decision to retain the files thereafter based on a \nmisconception that all of the files in the office which Brown had occupied for twenty years (and \nwhich bore his name and which was still occupied by his prior staff members) , belonged to him. \n(RT 3/13/25, pp. 143-158.) Her belief was based on misinformation unintentionally supplied to \nher and to their counsel, the Whites, by Baird Brown, who was experiencing significant memory \nissues and cognitive decline due to Parkinsons disease and a significant Covid-19 illness. She \ndid admit, however, that she and her husband (with counsel), decided to withhold files, despite \nbeing told that at least some of the cases had never belonged to Baird Brown. Those files are \nnow in storage, paid for by Mrs. Brown and have not been returned because Mr. Norris would \nnot first provide a list of his clients by name so that they could determine true ownership of each \nof the sequestered files. This impasse has gone on for more than a year and half without \nresolution. (Id., at pp. 170-173.) \nAfter October 21, 2023, the parties entered into a written agreement by which the Brown \nLaw firm agreed to provide the Norris law firm with a computer and Norris agreed to provide the \nBrown law firm with a list of all clients Norris claimed to be his exclusive clients. (RT 2/28/24 \nat pp. Exh.115-120; and Exh. 1694.) The agreement contained other tem1s about how the parties \ncould recover their claimed intellectual material and client files. While Norris signed the \nagreement, he later thought better of it and decided not to provide client names because of \nattorney client privilege concerns. (Id.) Norris admits that he was allowed back in the office on \nOctober 23, 2025, at which time he was \"probably\" given the ability to take all of his bank books \nand check books for his business accounts and for his client trust account. He was also allowed \nto identify all files that he wanted copied. However , Norris explained at trial that he was only \ngiven an hour or so, which was not enough time to go through all the files. (RT 2/28/25 at pp. \n120-125.) He also was very upset by the process, which allowed the Brown law firm to keep a \ncompany regenerated invoices working off old templates. Ultimately, plaintiffs failed to produce \ncredible evidence that Pak or Norris knowingly presented falsified invoices for the computers. \n37 "}, {"page": 38, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 copy of his client files -files to which he contends they had no right of access and should only \nhave been able to obtain with a court order. (Id.) Nonetheless, the court finds that at least some \nof the files he claims were not returned to him, in fact were returned to him only a few days after \nthe October 21, 2023 incident, including client files of clients he claims he could not contact, \nundermining his claim that he lost contact with all 200 clients. (RT 3/13/25 at pp. 52-63.) \nNorris testified that because of plaintiffs' takeover of their office and files, they lost 13 7 \nclients from the Camp Lejeune litigation relating to toxic ground water -clients who they had \nobtained by paying a company for \"leads.\" All of these clients, Norris testified, had agreed to be \nrepresented by the Norris firm and had signed retainer agreements with the firm. (3/5/25 p. 120: \n18-130:18, and Exhs. 15526 and 15527.) They had paid $200,000 for leads to potential clients in \nthis case, from which they had obtained 500 clients, but lost contact with 137 after 10/31/23. \n(Id.) Norris testified that they had paid $50,000 for leads to clients in the Boy Scouts of America \ncases, $100,000 for clients in the \"firefighters' litigation, \" and $50,000 for hernia mesh leads, \nalthough Norris conceded he had not been able to quantity how many clients the lost from the \nhernia mesh litigation. (RT 3/5/25, pp.123:20-128 :10.) He also did not quantify how many of \nthese clients were actually retained as a result of these leads, nor did he testify clearly about the \nsteps taken to connect with them. He explained that for cases in which work had commenced, \nthat work would be in the SugarSync system which they lost access to after October 21, 2023; \nfor other clients, their information would have been on computers, but not on the computers \ngiven back to them by the Whites. They did contact the lead firms from which they had \npurchased the client's names and information and were able to contact some clients by those \nmeans. Nonetheless, clients dropped them either because they were upset about the lack of \ncontact or because the Norris firm had lost their files on October 21, 2023; Norris claims there \nwere four boxes of client documents to which he was denied access, a point conceded by \nplaintiff Ann Brown. (RT 3/7/25, pp. 14-25, and Exh. 15525.) \nUltimately , Norris testified that he was able to identify 200 clients for which they had a \nretainer agreement or knew that they had been retained even if the retainer agreement could not \nbe found -all clients who later dropped the firm, he claims. (Id., at p. 25-29.) To quantify the \nfinancial loss suffered by his firm as a result of the loss of these clients, Norris simply multiplied \nthe number of lost clients times the amount paid per lead, for a total claimed loss of $605,074.) \n(Id., atp. 152:4-159:1 and Exh. 15561.) \nAlthough the evidence presented of the Browns withholding files and disrupting Norris's \nability to contact his clients is sufficient to establish a claim for conversion , the court finds \nNorris has not established actual damages. \nCross-complainants contend that they are not seeking speculative damages (for example, the \namounts they might have recovered had they been able to continue their representation of these \nclients uninterrupted), but only their out-of-pocket costs in paying for these leads in the first \ninstance. The court agrees that in principle, the out-of-pocket costs of paying for leads would be \ncompensable based on wrongful interference with Norris Law Corporation's business. \nNonetheless, the court finds that cross-complainants have not proven actual damages as a result \nof the wrongful retention of their files because cross-defendants have established that the Norris \ncross-complainants could have mitigated their damages but failed to do so. The court notes that \nCivil Code Section 3336 (Conversion) requires the plaintiff to establish the amount \"sufficient to \nindemnify the party injured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of \n38 "}, {"page": 39, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \nIO \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 the wrongful act complained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not \nhave averted.\" Thus, Section 3336 incorporates the concept of mitigation into the affirmative \nburden of proof placed on the plaintiff. \nThe evidence established that Norris and the Whites were in contact immediately after Norris \nwas barred from the office and his files taken. orris and the Whites entered into an agreement \nby which Norris could have the files returned to him provided he indicated which files he needed \nreturned. (Exh. 1694.) Norris decided not to abide by this agreement because he claims he \nconcluded that it would violate the attorney-client privilege to provide client names. The court \nfinds this contention unavailing from a legal standpoint and also not credible based on the facts \npresented. \nOrdinarily the disclosure of a client's name by the attorney does not violate the attorney \nclient privilege. (See People ex rel Herrera v. Stender (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 614, 648-650.) \nHad Norris provided the list as initially agreed, he would not be breaching the privilege with \nthose clients. Furthermore, the position he took actually interfered with his representation of \nthose clients, preventing him from continuing to represent their interests in a timely and effective \nmanner. Because he refused to provide a list of client names to plaintiffs, he had no access to \nthese clients' files and could not contact or represent them. Such conduct was unreasonable \nunder the circumstances and appears to this court to have been taken to maximize a claim for \ndamages rather than to protect his clients' best interests. Had Norris simply provided the names, \nobtained the original files and allowed Brown to keep a copy of the files (with an agreement that \nthey would not be reviewed), any damage to the clients would have been prevented, as we�l as \nany financial loss to the Norris firm. Under the circumstances, the court finds that this conduct \non the part of the Norris firm is a clear example of failure to mitigate damages. It is well­\nestablished that a \"plaintiff cannot be compensated for damages that were not incurred or could \nhave been mitigated by reasonable effort or expenditures.\" (Powerhouse Motorsports GrO'/i'P, \nInc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., USA (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 884, citing Lu v. Grewal (2005) 130 \nCal.App.4th 841, 849-850.) Further, as indicated elsewhere in the statement of decision, it was \nreasonable for the Brown defendants to initially take the files and to insist that they be able to \nretain a copy, not to review, but to ensure they were not later accused of destroying documents or \nfailing to return them, as happens unfortunately, with great frequency in disputes over retention \nof files. \nIn sum, the only credible evidence of damages presented by the Norris cross-complainants \nfor their claim of conversion relates to the cost of supplies, computers, advertising and staff time \nto reconstruct files, or a total of $60,670.75. \n2.Second Cause of Action (Violation of Penal Code§ 502, CACI 1812, 1814)\nThe Norris cross-complainants claim that cross-defendants intentionally and knowingly \naccessed and copied confidential digital files belonging to the Norris Law Firm without consent, \nin violation of Penal Code section 502. \nThe court finds that cross-complainants have established that cross-defendants intentionally \naccessed and copied confidential digital files belonging to the orris Law Firm without consent. \nIndeed, Jonathan White admitted that all computers were forensically imaged using Pixley \nForen ics at the Browns' direction, without any investigation into whether those computer� were \n39 "}, {"page": 40, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 the property of the Norris firm (RT 3/14/25, J. White, cross, 32:2-34:28; 55: 1-63:4). Mr. Norris \nobjected in time and advised the parties that his active client files were stored on those systems \n(Ex. 15558). Even if some of the data had once belonged to the Brown Law Firm, some of the \ndata certainly belonged exclusively to the Norris Law Firm. \nPenal Code Section 502 provides: \"In addition to any other civil remedy available , the owner \nor lessee of the computer, computer system, computer network, computer program, or data who \nsuffers damage or loss by reason of a violation of any of the provision s of subdivision ( c) may \nbring a civil action against the violator for compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other \nequitable relief. Compensatory damages shall include any expenditure reasonably and \nnecessarily incurred by the owner or lessee to verify that a computer system, computer network, \ncomputer program, or data was or was not altered, damaged, or deleted by the access. \nThe court finds that the contents of the four storage files maintained by Ann Brown must be \nimmediately returned to Norris, as well as all of the computers in the office at the time of the \ntake over. With respect to the issue of damages, the court finds that the loss described above is \nalso recoverable under Section 502, specifically, the cost of staff to attempt to restore the files, \nthe costs of the computers, or a total of $26,445.75. These expenses can only be recovered once. \nThe remainder of the damages established for conversion are unrelated to unlawful access to the \ncomputers and so are not recoverable under Section 502. The claimed damages related to the \nlost leads are not recoverable for the reasons stated above. \n3. Liability of Andrew and Jonathan White for Conversion and Violation of Pena \nCode Section 502 \nCross-defendants Jonathan and Andrew White contend that they cannot be liable to cross­\ncomplainants for damages caused by their clients' entry into the office and retention of case files. \nThe court agrees that that their conduct was committed in good faith, based on a genuine, albeit \nmistaken belief, that Baird Brown's office and case files had been commandeered by Donald \nNorris and Michele Pak, without Brown's knowledge of consent. Under the agency immunity \ndoctrine, the Whites cannot be liable \"to third persons for acts committed in good faith in \nperformance of professional activities as an attorney for his client.\" (Roberts v. Ball, Hunt, Harl, \nBrown & Baerwitz (1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 104, 109.) Norris and Pak did not establish that the \nWhites' conduct was \"actuated by malicious motives,\" or that they \"shared in the illegal motives \nof [their] clients.\" (Id., at p. 109.) On the contrary, at all times the Whites were acting solely as \nattorneys on behalf of their client, who they reasonably believed had been deceived . The court \nalso agrees with cross-defendant s that Norris and Pak did not establish any of the exceptions to \nthis agency immunity doctrine: there was no or insufficient evidence that the Whites engaged in \nany fraud, or that they conspired with the Browns, or that they received any financial gain \nbecause of their activities. At most, Pak and Norris established that the Whites, at some point, \ndiscovered or reasonably should have discovered that some of the files they had sequestered \nprobably belonged solely to the Norris law firm. But their conduct in requesting that Norris \nprovide them a I ist of clients whose files needed to be returned was not unreasonable and 'Yas \ntaken to protect the Browns from claims that they had not returned Norris's client files. Thus, \nthe Brown's failure to return cases files was done solely to protect the client and not for the \npersonal benefit of the attorneys. Accordingly, judgment should be entered in favor of the \nWhite defendants on the cross-complaint. \n40 "}, {"page": 41, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 4. Damages pursuant to Penal Code Section 496(c). \nCross-comp lainants also seek treble damages pursuant to Penal Code Section 496(c), \nwhich provides that \"[e]very person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or \nthat has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing the property to be \nso stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds , or aids in concealing, selling, or \nwithholding any property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained,\" is \nsubject to incarceration. Subdivision (c) states that any person who has been injured by a \nviolation of section 496(a) \"may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages, if \nany, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney's fees.\" \nWhile the language is broad, the Supreme Court has clarified that treble damages and \nattorney fees are only available in cases which constitute criminal theft. (Siry Investment , L.P. v. \nFarkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333, 361.) The court explained, \"not all commercial or \nconsumer disputes alleging that a defendant obtained money or property through fraud, \nmisrepresentation, or breach of a contractual promise will amount to a theft. To prove theft, a \nplaintiff must establish criminal intent on the part of the defendant beyond \"mere proof of \nnonperformance or actual falsity.\" (People v. Ashley (1954) 42 Cal.2d 246,264,267 P.2d 271.). \n... If misrepresentations or unfulfilled promises \"are made innocently or inadvertently, they can \nno more form the basis for a prosecution for obtaining property by false pretenses than can an \ninnocent breach of contract.\" (Id., at p. 264,267 P.2d 271.)\" (Siry at p. 361.) In Siry, the record \napproved an award of treble damages because the evidence was \"consistent with a conclusion \nthat defendants acted not innocently or inadvertently, but with careful planning and deliberation \nreflecting the requisite criminal intent.\" (Id.) \nIn the instant case, cross-complainants have not established anything approaching \ncriminal intent on the part of the Browns ( or the Whites). In the court's opinion, Baird Brown di \nnot appear to have the mental faculties to possess criminal intent; he persuaded the court that he \ntruly believes that all of the cases are his and that he was betrayed by Pak and Norris. His wife \nand his attorneys reasonably believed in the summer and fall of 2023 that Baird Brown had been \nthe victim of fraud and elder abuse by his trusted office manager and Norris. They did not know \nand could not know the communications which had occurred between Norris and Brown in 2019 \nas Brown had hidden that information from his wife due to his embarrassment that he was giving \nup the practice of law and facing a year long suspension. Thus, their conduct in seizing the \ncomputers and files was not unreasonable on October 21, 2023. Thereafter, the parties took lega \npositions as to whether the files should be returned en masse and uncopied or whether the White \nand Ms. Brown had to retain a copy to protect themselves from being accused of destroying files \nBased on this stalemate between the various attorneys involved, the files remained locked up in \nstorage shed and this litigation unfolded. This sad situation is many things, but it is not crirnina \ntheft. According ly, cross-complainants request for treble damages and attorney fees is denied. \n4. Punitive Damages \nCross-complainants failed to establish that cross-defendants acted with malice, fraud or \noppression. Although the court finds that the Browns and their counsel should not have \nwithheld files from Norris, the court finds that the decisions which led up to their entry into the \noffice and retention of files were based on misinformation supplied by Baird Brown due to his \nown failing memory and cognitive function. The court finds that by the fall of 2023, Brown had \nforgotten that he had transferred many of his cases to Norris, that he had blessed Pak's work wit \n41 "}, {"page": 42, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Norris, that Norris had been given permission to use his office and share his staff, and that Pak \nwas no longer working for him, except to complete closing out some personal injury cases. He \nconveyed this information to his wife and to his counsel, leading them to take aggressive steps to \nreclaim the office and files, which they quite reasonably believed belonged to the Brown Law \nOffices. Their subsequent conduct is explainable by the misinformation provided to them by a \nclient experiencing serious mental decline. Their conduct under these circumstances cannot be \nconstrued as malicious , fraudulent or oppressive -merely gravely mistaken . \nORDERS ON THE FINAL STATEMENT OF DECISION \nThe Clerk of the Court is directed to file thjs Statement and cause copies to be served by \nmail upon the parties' counsel.

RULING ON OBJECTIONS SUBMITTED BY CROSS-DEFENDANTS \nANDREW M. WHITE AND JONATHAN N. WHITE \nCross-Defendant s Andrew and Jonathan White's objection to the Statement of Decision's \nfinding that they are jointly and severally liable for acts of conversion committed by the Browns \nis granted. The court agrees that their conduct was committed in good faith, based on a genuine, \nalbeit mistaken belief, that Baird Brown's office and case files had been commandeered by \nDonald Norris and Michele Pak, without Brown's knowledge or consent. Under the agency \nimmunity doctrine, the Whites cannot be liable \"to third persons for acts committed in good faith \nin performance of professional activities as an attorney for his client.\" (Roberts v. Ball, Hunt, \nHart, Brown & Baerwitz (1976) 57 Cal.App.3d l 04, 109.) Norris and Pak did not establish that \nthe Whites' conduct was \"actuated by malicious motives,\" or that they \"shared in the illegal \nmotives of [their] clients.\" (Id., at p. 109.) On the contrary, at all times the Whites were acting \nsolely as attorneys on behalf of their client, who they reasonably believed had been deceived. \nThe court also agrees with cross-defendants that Norris and Pak did not establish any of the \nexceptions to the agency immunity doctrine: there was no or insufficient evidence that the \nWhites engaged in any fraud, or that they conspired with the Browns, or that they received any \nfinancial gain because of their activities. At most, Pak and Norris established that the Whites, at \nsome point, discovered or reasonably should have discovered that some of the files they had \nsequestered probably belonged solely to the Norris law firm. But their conduct in requesting that \nNorris provide them a list of clients whose files needed to be returned was not unreasonable (see \nbelow) and was taken to protect the Browns from claims that they had not returned Norris 's \nclient files. Thus, the Whites' failure to return cases files was done solely to protect their client \nand not for the personal benefit of the attorneys. The statement of decision has been corrected \nto remove any finding of liability against Andrew and Jonathan White. \nII. PLAINTIFFS' OBJECTIONS TO THE ST A TEMENT OF DECISION \nA. Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Pak \nPlaintiffs object to the proposed statement of decision on the grounds that it overlooks or \nmisinterprets some of the financial records admitted into evidence or places undue weight on the \ntestimony of Pak, which the court in other parts of the opinion found lacking in credibility. The \ncourt agrees that it misinterpreted or overlooked certain evidence and that this aspect of the \ncourt's decision warrants revision. The court notes, however, that it is bound by the arguments \npresented in the closing brief and will not revisit evidence or argument that was not advanced \nthere. It is not the job of the court to rummage through bank statements to try to find \ninconsistencies or support for positions that counsel did not squarely present at trial or in their \nclosing arguments. \nIn their closing brief, plaintiffs took the position that Pak breached her fiduciary duty to \nplaintiffs by using money in the Law Office's business money (BofA account #3119) to \npurchase $653,500 in leads in 2019. Those purchases are as follows: \nMay 14, 2019 wire transfer of $195,000 to B Partners. (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 38.) \nMay 31, 2019 wire transfer of $48,500 to SMG (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 38) \nJune 3, 2019 transfer of$100,000 to SMG (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 48) \n2 "}, {"page": 45, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 August 19, 2019 transfer of $40,000 to OPL (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 64) \nOctober 21, 2019 transfer of$135,000 to B Partners (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 86.) \nOctober 22, 2019 transfer of$135,000 to B Partners (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 86.) \nThese are the transactions fairly presented in plaintiffs' closing brief and at trial. These are \nthe only transactions which the court considers further as a result of the objections lodged by \nplaintiffs. 1 \nThe court asked for further briefing from Pak' s counsel to explain the source of these \nfunds and to respond to the objections. The court finds Pak's explanation unhelpful in many \nrespects or not squared with the evidence presented. The court discusses each of these \ntransactions further below. \nIt is undisputed that Pak purchased leads from several firms at a total cost of $653,500 in \n2019 for use by the Norris firm. The evidence also showed that some of these funds originated \nin the Brown Client Trust Account, were transferred by Pak to the Brown Business Account \n(account ending 3119) and were then wired by Pak to third parties to purchase several tranches \nof client leads. The court finds that Pak had full authority and access to both of those accounts \npursuant to her agreement with Brown. The court also finds that Brown was writing checks from \nthe same two accounts in 2019 and so would have been aware of these transactions but made no \nobjection. The court finds that Brown knew that Pak was purchasing leads (because of the name \nof the payee) but did not know that she was purchasing leads for the Norris firm as opposed to \nthe Baird firm. Plaintiffs met their burden at trial of establishing that some of these funds either \noriginated in the Baird Brown Client Trust Account or the business account, which would \nconstitute a breach of fiduciary duty if those funds were used for anything other than the benefit \nof the firm and/or Brown. Thus, the burden shifted to Pak to establish that these funds, in fact, \nbelonged to her to use as she elected. The court finds that Pak has not met that burden with \nrespect to all of these transaction s. \nIn her response to plaintiffs' objections filed on November 3, 2025, Pak claims that the \ndisputed purchases of $635,500 in leads for the Norris firm \"were funded by Ms. Pak through a \ncombination of direct contributions and assumed obligations:\" \n• $335,000 wired into BrownLaw 's account from Ms. Pak's personal funds (Ex. B, \nTrial Tr. 2/14/25 at 50: 15-28, 52:4-6) \n• $230,000 from a loan originally made to Mr. Brown by Carolina Navarro, which \nMs. Pak assumed (Ex. B, Trial Tr. 2/14/25 at 51 :5-58:10; Ex.

B, Trial Tr. 2/14/25 at 53:1-2; TrEx 7, p. 13) \n(Response of Defendant/Cross-complainant Pak to Plaintiffs ' Objections to Court Proposed \nStatement of Decision , p. 3.) As explained further below, these assertions do not establish that \nall of these lead purchases were funded by Pak's own money or money she was owed under her \n1 Plaintiffs make various references to Exh. 15528. The parties stipulated that the court could \nreopen the taking of evidence to admit the entirety of this exhibit. \n3 I I "}, {"page": 46, "text": "1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 profit-sharin g agreement with Brown. \nThe first transaction that the Browns challenge as suspect was a $195,000 payment from \nthe Brown Business Account (3119) dated May 14, 2019 to purchase leads from a company \nreferred to as \"B Partners.\" The bank records show that this same amount was transferred by \nPak to account 3119 a day before from the BrownLaw client trust account. (Exh. 8, p. 27.) The \nsame is true for the next purchase of leads made on May 31, 2019 in the amount of $48,500. \n(Exh. 7, p. 38.) The evidence shows this money was paid out of the business account by Pak, \nfollowing a deposit into the account from the client trust account by Pak. (Id .. ) Thus, by the end \nof May 2019, Pak had taken $243,500 out of the Client Trust Account to purchase leads for \nNorris. \nPak explained these expenditures as follows: She claims that as of May 14, she had an \nearnings credit of $100,000 in the Client Trust Account from February 2019 because in February \nBrownLaw had issued $215,000 to Brown and $ 1 15,000 to Pak' s company USCV, shorting her \nby $100,000. She also presented evidence that she had a credit of $230,000 with BrownLaw \nbecause she had assumed a loan in that amount owed by a former client to Baird Brown. That \nevidence was not refuted and was corroborated by the client, Carolina Navarro. (3/7/2 Tr. \n136:20-26. ) Moreover , Pak presented evidence that the court found credible that Brown was \nreviewing all of these transactions and raised no objections to them. As stated elsewhere in this \nopinion, Brown was fully competent in 2019 and handling his business affairs. Moreover, he \nknew the leads were not being purchased for the Brown firm because he was stepping back from \nthe firm, transferring his clients to Norris and not intending to practice law in the future. He \ncould not have intended Pak to be purchasing hundreds of leads for his own firm, since he had no \nlawyer (other than Norris) associating in to handle these cases. \nNonetheless , Pak was responsible for managing the payments and the books and her accounting \npractices likely were confusing to Brown. Her testimony that she had an earned income credit \nof $100,000 as of May 2019 was demonstrated to be false by the records submitted and the \ntestimony of plaintiffs' expert Holstrom. Indeed, by May 14, 2019, Pak had already transferred \n$40,000 (two checks of $20,000) to herself from the business account, reducing any credit to \n$60,000. The evidence presented also showed that by October 14, 2019, she had transfen;ed \nanother $75,000 to her company , without comparable payouts to Brown. (Exh. 7.) Thus, the \n$100,000 credit was ephemeral. At best, plaintiffs admit Pak had a credit of $20,000 by the end \nof 2019. (See Brief, at p. 7, Ins. 11-15.) \nAccordingly, the court finds that Pak has presented adequate evidence that she had \n$230,000 in a credit, justifying her transfer of $230,000 of the $243,500 from the client trust \naccount in May 2019 to purchase leads. She has not adequately explained the additional $13,50 \nshe transferred in May. \nTurning to the June 3, 2019 wire transfer of$ I 00,000 from the business account to \npurchase leads from SMG, plaintiffs failed to establish that this expenditure was improper. \nImmediately before this wire transfer out, Pak wired $200,000 of her own money into the \naccount. (Tr Exh. 7, p. 48.) Even if her testimony about this transfer was confusing at trial, that \ntestimony did not make this transaction a breach of her fiduciary duty to Brown. The parties had \nan understanding , the court finds, that the business account could be used by Pak to conduct \nthese types of transactions, even if not for the immediate benefit of Brown or the BrownLaw \nfirm. Thus, the $100,000 spent on June 3 is adequately accounted for by Pak and does not \n4 "}, {"page": 47, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 constitute a breach of her fiduciary duty to plaintiffs. But the court agrees with Plaintiffs that \nPak then transferred $100,000 out of the account for her own purposes, leaving no excess to \ncover the other transactions discussed below. \nWith respect to the August 19, 2019 transfer of $40,000 to OPL, Pak has not presented \ncredible evidence that she had a credit or other money available to her in the Client Trust \nAccount, which would cover this payment to OPL. Therefore, plaintiffs have established that \nPak breached her fiduciary duty by transferring funds from the client trust account to cover this \nlead purchase . \nWith respect to the two $135,000 purchases of leads from B Partners made on October 21 \nand 22, 2019 out of the business account, $135,000 was transferred by Pak from the Client Trust \nAccount into account 3119 to make these purchases and $135,000 came from plaintiffs own \nmoney. (See Exh. 8, p. 55 and Exh. 7, p. 86.) Pak was not able to present any credible evidence \nas to why she would be entitled to claim $135,000 of the client trust account money as her own \nat that point in time. Accordingly, plaintiffs have established that she breached her fiduciary \nduty to Baird Brown when she used client trust account funds to purchase $135,000 in leads in \nOctober 2019. \nIn sum, the court agrees with plaintiffs that they have established that Pak breached her \nfiduciary duty to plaintiffs by using $188,500 of money belonging to the firm and/or Brown to \npurchase leads for the Norris firm. \nB. Elder Abuse \nThe court found in its initial statement of decision that Pak had breached her fiduciary duty t \nBrown in her handling of the rental payments. In the amended statement of decision, the court \nnow finds that Pak also breached her fiduciary duty by her use of firm funds to purchase leads in \n2019 for the Norris firm in the amount of $188,500. Plaintiffs object to the statement of \ndecision's failure to find that such conduct also constitutes financial elder abuse. Elder financia \nabuse under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 15600, et seq. includes the wrongful taking o \n\"real or personal property of an elder by undue influence as defined in Section 15610.70. \" \nSection 15610.30(b) provides that \"A person or entity shall be deemed to have taken, secreted, \nappropriated, obtained, or retained property for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person \nor entity takes, secretes, appropriates , obtains, or retains the property and the person or entity \nknew or should have known that this conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder or dependent \nadult.\" The court sustains the objection that the court failed to discuss the impact of the court's \nfindings with respect to breach of fiduciary duty on the elder abuse claim. \nPlaintiffs established that Pak's breach of her fiduciary duty to Brown constitutes financial \nelder abuse within the meaning of the statute. The court notes that plaintiffs did not establish \nthat Norris participated in the wrongful taking, or that he knew the source of the money used to \npurchase leads, or understood that Pak was using Brown's money to pay the lease for his office. \nThus, Norris is not liable under the Elder Abuse statute. \nBecause plaintiffs established by a preponderance of the evidence that Pak engaged in \nconduct which amounts to elder financial abuse, \"as defined in Section 15610.30, in addition to \ncompensatory damages and all other remedies otherwise provided by law, the court shall award \n5 "}, {"page": 48, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 to the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\"(§ 15657.5, subd. (a), italics added.) \"The \nattorney fee provision in section 15657.5 is not discretionary in nature.\" (Arace v. Medico \nInvestments , LLC. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 977, 983.) Pak is also potentially liable for treble \ndamages under Civil Code Section 3345. However, as explained further in the amended \nStatement of Decision, the court finds a multiplier is not appropriate here because of the poor \nrecord-keeping and intermingling of funds by both Pak and Brown. The court will amend the \nStatement of Decision to reflect these findings. \nc. Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Pak relating to the Roh Case \nPlaintiffs failed to produce persuasive evidence that Pak's conduct with respect to the Roh \ncase violated her fiduciary duty to Brown. As stated throughout the opinion, the court finds that \nBrown acquiesced in the transfer of his cases to the Norris firm because of his health issues, the \nstate bar investigation and his understanding that he did not have the ability to continue to litigate \nthese cases. There was no evidence that Pak used undue influence on the Roh family or that Mr. \nBrown was unaware of the transfer. If Brown truly believed he was still representing Roh, he \nwould have exercised his professional obligations to keep abreast of the case and would have \nimmediately seen that a substitution had been filed, replacing his office with that of Mr. Norris's. \nHad Brown believed that he was still responsible for the case, he would have known that \nsettlement and litigation activity was taking place without him. The fact that he did nothing is \nirrefutable evidence that he consented to the substitution . There can be no breach of a fiduciary \nduty where the party to whom the duty is owed consents to the conduct about which he later \ncomplains . \nd. Rulings on Michele Pak 's Cross-Complaint \nIn their objections, plaintiffs correctly point out that the court failed to rule on Pak's first \nthrough seventh causes of action in her cross-complaint: 1) Breach of Contract, 2) Money Had \nand Received, 3) Open Book Account, 4) Account Stated, 5) Conversion , 6) Unauthorized \nComputer Access (violation of Penal Code §502), and 7) Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code \n§ 17200, et seq. The court finds as follows with respect to these causes: Cross-Complainant Pak \nfailed to establish all of the elements for these causes of action, entitling cross-defendants to \njudgment on these claims. \nIII. RULING ON OBJECTIONS BY CROSS-DEFENDANTS/CROSS \nCOMPLAINANTS' DONALD G. NORRIS AND DONALD G. NORRIS A \nLAW CORPORATION \nA. Damages for Lead and Client Acquisition Losses \nCross-Complainants Donald G. Norris and the Donald G. Norris Law Corporation object to \nthe proposed statement of decision on the grounds it does not adequately compensate cross­\ncomplainants for the losses they suffered as a result of cross-defendants' take-over of their office \nand refusal to return their case files. Cross-complainants contend that they are not seeking \nspeculative damages (for example, the amounts they might have recovered had they been able to \ncontinue their representation of these clients uninterrupted), but only their out-of-pocket costs in \npaying for these leads in the first instance. \n6 "}, {"page": 49, "text": "2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 The court agrees that in principle, the out-of-pocket costs of paying for leads would be \ncompensable based on wrongful interference with Norris Law Corporation 's business. The court \nwill revise the Statement of Decision to so provide. Nonetheless, the court finds that cross­\ncomplainants have not proven actual damages as a result of the wrongful retention of their files \nbecause cross-defendants have established that the Norris cross-complainants could have \nmitigated their damages but failed to do so.2 The court notes that Civil Code Section 3336 \n(Conversion) requires the plaintiff to establish the amount \"sufficient to indemnify the party \ninjured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of the wrongful act \ncomplained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not have averted. \" \nThus, Section 3336 incorporates the concept of mitigation into the affirmative burden of proof \nplaced on plaintiff. \nThe evidence established that Norris and the Whites were in contact immediately after Norris \nwas barred from the office and his files taken. Norris and the Whites entered into an agreement \nby which Norris could have the files returned to him provided he indicated which files he needed \nreturned. (Exh. 1694.) Norris decided not to abide by this agreement because he claims he \nconcluded that it would violate the attorney client privilege to provide client names. The court \nfinds this contention unavailing from a legal standpoint and also not credible based on the facts \npresented. \nOrdinarily the disclosure of a client's name by the attorney does not violate the attorney \nclient privilege. (See People ex rel Herrera v. Stender (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 614, 648-650.) \nHad Norris provided the list as initially agreed, he would not be breaching the privilege with \nthose clients. Furthermore, the position he took actually interfered with his representation of \nthose clients, preventing him from continuing to represent their interests in a timely and effective \nmanner. Because he refused to provide a list of client names to plaintiffs, he had no access to \nthese clients' files and could not contact or represent them. Such conduct was unreasonable \nunder the circumstances and appears to this court to have been taken to maximize a claim for \ndamages rather than to protect his clients' best interests. Had Norris simply provided the names, \nobtained the original files and allowed Brown to keep a copy of the files (with an agreement that \nthey would not be reviewed) , any damage to the clients would have been prevented, as well as \nany financial loss to the Norris firm. Under the circumstances , the court finds that this conduct \non the part of the Norris firm is a clear example of failure to mitigate damages. It is well-\n2 Although cross-defendants' Answer to the Norris Cross Complaint did not set forth the \naffirmative defense of \"failure to mitigate,\" they were not required to do so to preserve this issue \nfor resolution by the trier of fact. (See Erler v. Five Points Motors (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d \n560,568.) As Erler explains: \"The plaintiff has the burden of proving his damage. The law is \nsettled that he has the duty of minimizing that damage .... The 'elementary principles' of logic \nand fair play ... would surely be violated if the plaintiff were not to be subject to cross­\nexamination as to his own activities in relation to the case he has the burden of proving.\" \nMoreover, the same conduct which the court finds establishes a failure to mitigate on the part of \nthe Norris cross-complainants also supports a finding that those cross-complainants waived any \nclaim for damages based on the failure to return the files and/or consented to the withholding by \nvirtue of their refusal to provide adequate information for the files to be returned. Waiver was \nasserted as an affirmative defense in the Browns answer to the cross-complaint filed on February \n16, 2024. \n7 I "}, {"page": 50, "text": "' I \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 established that a \"plaintiff cannot be compensated for damages that were not incurred or could \nhave been mitigated by reasonable effort or expenditures.\" (Powerhouse Motorsports Group, \nInc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., USA (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 884, citing Lu v. Grewal (2005) 130 \nCal.App.4th 841, 849-850.) Further, as indicated elsewhere in the statement of decision, it was \nreasonable for the Brown defendants to initially take the files and to insist that they be able to \nretain a copy, not to review, but to ensure they were not later accused of destroying documents or \nfailing to return them, as happens unfortunately, with great frequency in disputes over retention \nof files. \nIT IS SO ORDERED \nt:-/1-\nDated this'./_ day of December 2025. \n8 "}]
