Reply Section — Focused for Ms. Pak (Polished)

Introduction — framing the dispute for Ms. Pak
Plaintiffs' opposition asks this Court to read the Final Statement of Decision (SOD) as a broad endorsement of every asserted theory of liability. That reading misstates the SOD. The SOD’s findings, properly read, (1) credit multiple documentary and third‑party corroborations that undercut Plaintiffs’ most consequential factual claims about Ms. Pak; (2) confine any fiduciary duty and remedies to narrow windows and discrete transactions; and (3) identify multiple factual bases that undercut any finding of systemic dishonest intent. This reply therefore focuses on the SOD findings that directly benefit Ms. Pak and on the places where Plaintiffs’ arguments improperly expand or misstate those findings. (See SOD, generally, pp. 20–24; 25–29; 30–33.)

I. The SOD’s credibility and documentary findings that support Ms. Pak
- The SOD expressly finds that many transfers and substitutions were consensual and that Brown voluntarily transferred contested cases beginning in 2019, with substitutions of counsel filed and processed. The court ties those conclusions to documentary evidence and corroborated testimony, not merely to self‑serving recollection. (SOD pp. 20–24; 21–22.)
- The SOD recounts contemporaneous communications (emails, text exchanges, substitution forms, and bank records) showing Brown’s involvement in or acquiescence to the transition. The SOD therefore relies on documentary corroboration—precisely the type of evidence on which the defense rests. (SOD pp. 3; 20–24.)
- The SOD also recognizes that Pak continued to operate the office, pay rent, and manage wind‑down matters—actions the SOD itself treats as part of an agreed transition rather than evidence of unilateral theft. (SOD §§III–IV; pp. 11–15; 22–24; 25–29.)

II. The SOD’s legal conclusions as to liability do not support Plaintiffs’ sweeping narrative
- Limited scope of liability: Judge Recana fixes the operative duty window and ties liability to specific transactions. The SOD limits recoverable wrongdoing to particular misuses of funds and lease obligations rather than endorsing a theory of continuous, open‑ended liability. (SOD §C, pp. 25–29.)
- No theft/ conversion theory against Ms. Pak (as Plaintiffs urge): the SOD emphasizes voluntary transfers and substitutions and rejects converting the transfer process into per se theft; the court’s own factual findings therefore narrow the universe of plausible remedies. (SOD pp. 20–24.)

III. Where the SOD’s findings undercut its conclusions as to Pak
- Documentary credit vs. conclusion tension: the SOD simultaneously (a) credits documentary evidence of consensual transfer, substitutions, and client notices, and (b) finds discrete fiduciary lapses by Pak. Those two positions can coexist only if the lapses are narrowly confined and causally tied to particular transactions—precisely the kind of limitation Plaintiffs ignore. Put differently, the SOD does not sustain Plaintiffs’ invitation to treat routine transitional conduct as blanket malfeasance. (SOD pp. 20–24; 25–29.)
- Post‑2020 exposure limited: the court found insufficient evidence to establish widespread breach of fiduciary duties relating to work Pak performed after April 1, 2020; any post‑2020 liability the SOD contemplates is case‑specific and fact‑based rather than categorical. (SOD §C, pp. 25–26.)
- Rent/lease and accounting issues were quantified and circumscribed by the SOD. The court awarded a specific, limited share of the balloon obligation and tied any award to demonstrated shortfalls—again contradicting Plaintiffs’ call for open‑ended damages. (SOD p.28.)

IV. Legal consequences for Plaintiffs’ arguments
- Plaintiffs’ broad requests (treble damages, expansive conversion/UC claims, punitive relief) are inconsistent with the SOD’s narrow remedial framework. The SOD denied punitive damages and explained the statutory preconditions for trebling under §3345, which Plaintiffs cannot supply here. (SOD §D–F, pp. 30–31.)
- Where the SOD found a breach tied to particular transactions, the proper remedy is likewise narrow: inquiry into the particular transfer, payment, or accounting entry—not a wholesale rewriting of the remedial map Plaintiffs propose. (SOD §§C–D, pp. 25–31.)

V. Practical relief requested on behalf of Ms. Pak
- Respect the SOD’s limitations: deny Plaintiffs relief that exceeds the SOD’s quantified awards and causation findings.
- Where the SOD identified specific conduct by Ms. Pak as actionable, limit any recovery to the discrete transactions the court identified and to damages the SOD itself quantified or expressly left open for post‑trial proof.

Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ motion to expand liability should be denied. The SOD, when read as a whole, both credits documentary and third‑party corroboration that supports Pak’s role in a consensual transition and confines liability to narrow, particularized breaches. The Court should therefore decline Plaintiffs’ invitation to rewrite the SOD into a generalized finding of systemic theft or malice and should enter judgment consistent with the SOD’s measured findings and quantified remedies.

Respectfully submitted.
