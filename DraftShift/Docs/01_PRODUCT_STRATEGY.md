# DraftShift Product Strategy: Civility Compliance Engine

## 🏛️ Market Opportunity: California Rule 9.7 Civility Initiative

### The Compliance Landscape
California's amended Rule 9.7 makes civility **mandatory**—not just aspirational. Attorneys must now file an annual declaration affirming their commitment to civility, courtesy, and integrity in professional conduct.

**The Problem:**
- Attorneys understand the principle but lack **actionable tools** to ensure daily compliance.
- Correspondence written under stress often violates civility standards unintentionally.
- No existing tool maps communication against professional ethical rules.

**The Opportunity:**
DraftShift transforms civility from an abstract oath into a **measurable, daily discipline**. We position it as the compliance ally for attorneys navigating these new mandates.

## ✨ Strategic Positioning

### Core Thesis
Most legal tech focuses on grammar or tone. **DraftShift is different:**
- Explicitly maps correspondence against professional oaths and ethical rules.
- Provides real-time risk alerts when tone drifts into incivility.
- Tracks patterns over time to support the annual Rule 9.7 declaration.
- Suggests actionable rewrites that maintain assertiveness while preserving professionalism.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Compliance-First Design**: Every feature supports Rule 9.7 compliance.
2. **Symbolic Glyph Overlays**: Visualize civility as a spectrum—showing when correspondence leans toward aggression, neutrality, or courtesy.
3. **Privacy-Preserving**: All analysis local; no attorney-client information leaves the device.
4. **Ethical Awareness**: Built by lawyers, for lawyers—respects attorney judgment and maintains attorney control.
