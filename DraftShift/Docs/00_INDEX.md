## 📋 Core Principles (Read These First)

### Privacy-First
- All processing happens locally on the attorney's device
- No API calls to external services
- No storage of correspondence by default
- User controls what is saved, shared, or deleted

### Attorney-Centric
- Tool suggests; attorney decides
- Full transparency into why civility score is what it is
- Preserves professional judgment
- Augments expertise, doesn't replace it

### Civility as Measurable Discipline
- Transforms abstract "civility oath" into actionable metrics
- Provides real-time feedback on correspondence tone
- Tracks patterns over time for compliance reporting
- Supports California Rule 9.7 annual declarations

### No Breaking Changes
- Existing DraftShift analysis modules (spaCy, TextBlob, NRC, signals) are **already working**
- All new features layer on top without modifying core
- Backward compatibility maintained across phases

---

## 🏗️ Current State of DraftShift

### ✅ Complete (Already Implemented)
- Core analysis modules: `enhanced_affect_parser.py`, `tone_signal_parser.py`, `tone_analysis_composer.py`

- spaCy + TextBlob multi-method analysis
- Constants + legal-specific markers

- Risk alert generation
- Streamlit MVP app

### 🔮 Future: Phase 2-3

```

**draftshift.tone_signal_parser**
```python
from draftshift.tone_signal_parser import create_tone_signal_parser
parser = create_tone_signal_parser()

```

**draftshift.enhanced_affect_parser**
```python
from draftshift.enhanced_affect_parser import create_enhanced_affect_parser
parser = create_enhanced_affect_parser()

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is the core analysis working now?**
A: Yes! All modules (spaCy, TextBlob, NRC, signals) are implemented and tested. Go to
[02_ARCHITECTURE.md](02_ARCHITECTURE.md) for architecture overview.

**Q: What do I build first?**
A: LLM integration (Phase 1). See [07_MASTER_ROADMAP.md](07_MASTER_ROADMAP.md) Phase 1 section for
exact tasks.

**Q: Can we skip Phase 1 and go straight to Phase 2?**
A: Not recommended. Phase 1 validates the concept quickly. Skip it only if you have strong user
demand + resources for full Phase 2 (200+ hours).

**Q: How do we handle attorney-client privilege?**
A: All processing is local; no external APIs. No storage by default. See
[02_ARCHITECTURE.md](02_ARCHITECTURE.md) "Privacy Model."

**Q: What's the civility scoring based on?**
A: Weighted algorithm combining sentiment polarity (30%), emotion profile (30%), signal balance
(20%), subjectivity (10%), modifiers (10%). See [07_MASTER_ROADMAP.md](07_MASTER_ROADMAP.md) Phase
1.2 for details.

**Q: Can we deploy to the cloud?**
A: Phase 1-2 are local-only or single-tenant cloud. Phase 3 adds multi-tenant cloud support. See
[06_DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md](06_DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md).
