STATEMENT OF DECISION

This matter came for trial before the Court on March 12-13, 2025. Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Baird Brown and Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Nina Brown (collectively "Plaintiffs" or "Brown") appeared by and through their counsel, William Baird, Esq. and James Martinez, Esq. Defendant/Cross-Complainant Michelle Pak ("Pak") appeared by and through her counsel, Taurin J. Robinson, Esq. Defendants Asher Norris ("Norris") and XYZ Legal, LLC (filed under a different entity name) ("XYZ Legal") did not appear.

Plaintiffs initially brought this matter as a breach of fiduciary duty action. Michelle Pak is a non-lawyer who worked with Baird Brown at his law firm (the "Brown Firm") from approximately 2003 until 2023. The complaint alleges that Pak breached her fiduciary duties to Brown in connection with various financial transactions occurring between 2019 and 2023, specifically related to the purchase of legal leads for a mass tort practice and the use of office space and rent payments. Plaintiffs also alleged elder financial abuse against both Pak and Norris under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 15610.30 et seq.

The Court finds that Pak breached her fiduciary duty to Brown with respect to certain lead purchases and rent payments between 2019 and 2023. The Court also finds that Pak's conduct constitutes financial elder abuse as defined by statute. With respect to Norris and XYZ Legal, the Court finds they are not liable for any of the claims brought against them.

FACTS

The Court's findings of fact are based upon the evidence presented at trial, including testimony from both parties' witnesses. Where the evidence is in conflict, the Court has made determinations of credibility based upon the demeanor of the witnesses and the surrounding circumstances.

A. Background and the Relationship Between Brown and Pak

Baird Brown is an attorney who has practiced law in California for over thirty years. Brown is now 74 years old and was 69-70 years of age during the events relevant to this case (2019-2023). Brown's law firm focused primarily on mass tort litigation, particularly asbestos and mesothelioma cases. The firm was referred to as either the "Brown Firm" or the "Baird Brown Firm" at various points.

In approximately 2003, Pak began working at the Brown Firm as a non-lawyer employee. Over the course of her employment, Pak's responsibilities expanded. By 2019, Pak was handling significant financial and operational matters for the firm, including management of client trust accounts, business accounts, accounting, billing, and other administrative functions. Brown testified that Pak was highly competent at her job and that he trusted her completely.

The relationship between Brown and Pak was not simply an employer-employee relationship. For years, they worked together closely on the firm's business matters. Brown was aware that Pak had taken on substantial financial risk and had made loans to and investments in the firm. Brown acknowledged that Pak had earned an interest in the firm's operations and success, and he frequently consulted with her regarding major business decisions.

Brown stated that he was "handling his business affairs" during the period from 2019 to 2023, and he reviewed financial statements and account statements related to the firm's operations. Brown testified that he was aware of the firm's finances and the various accounts maintained by Pak, including both client trust accounts and business operating accounts.

B. The Wind-Down of Brown's Practice and the Transition to Norris

Beginning around 2018-2019, Brown began to consider winding down his law practice. The record shows multiple discussions between Brown and various people, including his staff and Pak, regarding Brown's desire to step back from active practice. Brown was facing suspension by the State Bar and was contemplating retirement. During this period, Brown decided that he needed to bring in another attorney to handle his cases.

By 2019, Brown had begun discussions with Asher Norris regarding Norris taking over Brown's mass tort practice. The evidence showed that Brown and Norris discussed the transition of cases and the terms under which Norris would work with Brown's firm. Brown personally introduced Norris to staff members as the attorney who would be taking over cases from Brown.

Carolina Navarro, who worked at the Brown Firm as an office manager and legal assistant, provided testimony regarding the transition of the practice. Navarro testified that she had discussions with Brown in 2019 regarding his retirement and the transition of his practice to Norris. The Court found Navarro to be extremely credible and even guileless in her testimony. She testified that Brown was clearly discussing leaving the firm and practice, that multiple meetings occurred in 2019 about this transition, and that Brown personally introduced Norris to staff as the attorney taking over cases. She also testified regarding certain 3M cases being transferred to Norris and other details of the practice transition. Although Navarro's testimony contained some imprecision regarding dates, the Court credits her account of these events occurring during 2019.

Pakdid not testify regarding these transition events, but the evidence from multiple sources confirms that Brown knew he was winding down his practice, was facing professional difficulties, and had decided to bring in Norris to take over his cases.

C. The 2019 Lead Purchases

Beginning in 2019, the firm made several large purchases of legal leads. These lead purchases were funded through various combinations of Brown's client trust account, Brown's business account, and funds provided or credited by Pak. The specific transactions at issue are:

1. May 14, 2019: $195,000 purchase
2. May 31, 2019: $48,500 purchase
3. August 19, 2019: $65,000 purchase
4. October 22, 2019: $110,000 purchase

The total of the questioned transactions is approximately $418,500. However, the Court does not find liability for all of these amounts based on the following analysis.

D. Pak's Funding and Credits for Lead Purchases

The evidence at trial established that Pak had made substantial deposits to the firm's accounts and had been credited with significant amounts over the years. Specifically, the Court finds:

1. Pak deposited $195,000 on or about May 14, 2019, which was used for the lead purchase that same day.

2. Pak provided or credited $35,000 of the May 31, 2019 purchase ($48,500 total).

3. Pak had previously assumed a client loan in the amount of approximately $230,000, which created a substantial credit in her favor.

4. Pak had an earnings credit of approximately $100,000 based on her historical contributions to the firm.

5. Pak funded or had credited most of the lead purchases with her own deposits and credits.

The Court finds that Pak funded most of the lead purchases with her own money or credits, and that Brown had full access to the firm's financial records and accounts. Brown reviewed statements related to these accounts and had the ability to question any of these transactions but did not do so.


PAGE 6

E. Brown's Knowledge and Participation in Lead Purchases

The Court finds that Brown was aware of and participated in the lead purchases in the following ways:

1. Brown was writing checks from the same accounts from which the lead purchases were being made, demonstrating that he had full knowledge of the accounts and their use.

2. Brown reviewed financial statements and account information related to these transactions.

3. Brown did not object to any of the lead purchases when he became aware of them.

4. Brown understood that the firm was purchasing leads as part of its business operations.

5. The lead purchases were made in furtherance of Brown's stated intention to develop a new mass tort practice or to transition the practice to Norris.

6. Brown knew he was not purchasing leads for his own personal benefit or for use by himself, given that he was stepping back from active practice.

The Court finds that Brown had full access to information about these transactions and understood their general purpose. While the Court cannot find a reasonable explanation for the source of funds for some of these transactions based on the documentary evidence presented, the Court finds that Brown was aware of and consented to the general use of firm funds for lead purchases.


PAGE 7

F. The May 2019 Lead Purchases and the Identification with Norris

The Court must address with particularity the purchasing and intended use of the leads purchased in May 2019. The evidence presented at trial showed that in May 2019, lead purchases were made in the amounts specified above. The question is whether these leads were purchased with the intent that they be used by Brown or by Norris, or whether the parties' intentions changed over time.

The testimony was somewhat conflicting and imprecise on this point. However, the Court makes the following finding:

Although Pak did not explicitly admit this, based on the totality of circumstances and the timeline, the Court concludes that she likely purchased the leads in May 2019 with the intent that they be used by Brown, but when Norris agreed to take over the practice, she then began to identify and treat these as leads purchased for Norris. The Court does not find that she was prescient about being able to work with Norris, or that Norris had a deal or understanding prior to June 2019 that they would be working together in any capacity. Rather, the initial May purchases appear to have been intended for Brown, with a later recharacterization once the Norris transition became clear.

The evidence did not support a finding that there was a pre-existing secret agreement between Pak and Norris regarding the lead purchases or the practice transition. The transition to Norris appears to have been genuinely initiated by Brown based on his desire to wind down his practice, not by Pak or Norris.


PAGE 8

G. Navarro's Testimony Regarding the Transition and Office Operations

As noted above, the Court found Carolina Navarro to be extremely credible and even guileless in her testimony. Navarro testified regarding the following matters:

1. She had conversations with Brown in 2019 regarding his plans to retire or wind down his practice.

2. Brown discussed leaving the firm in multiple meetings with staff during 2019.

3. Brown personally introduced Norris to staff members as the attorney who would be taking over cases from the firm.

4. She was aware of certain clients and cases being transferred to Norris.

5. She had discussions with Pak regarding the management of the office space and rental arrangements.

6. She observed Pak assuming financial responsibilities for the office, including rent and utilities, at various points during the time period in question.

The Court credited Navarro's testimony in full regarding these matters. Her testimony was consistent, compelling, and reflected her direct knowledge of these events. Although she acknowledged that she did not retain precise recollection of all dates, the Court found her testimony regarding the general sequence of events and the facts she observed to be credible and reliable.


PAGE 9

H. Office Space and Rent Payments

The firm's office space was located at [ADDRESS]. The lease for the office space was in Brown's name. During the period from 2019 through October 2023, there was an office-sharing arrangement between Brown, Pak, and at various points, Norris.

Brown testified that he required Pak to use the office space to wind down his remaining cases. Pak continued to use the office to work on administrative matters and to support the transition of the practice. Norris used the office space to work on transitioned cases and to support the firm's operations during the transition period.

The monthly rent for the office space varied but was in the range of $4,000-$5,000 per month during the relevant period. The Court finds the following regarding rent payments:

1. Brown made rent payments from the business account until April 2020.

2. After April 2020, Brown made no further rent payments despite remaining on the lease.

3. Ms. Pak paid most of the rent during the period from April 2020 through October 2023, using funds from both the business account (to which she had access and for which she was responsible for accounting) and her own personal funds.

4. Norris contributed to rent payments in the amount of $15,000 during his period of occupancy.

5. The exact allocation of rent payments among the three parties is not entirely clear from the documentary evidence, but it is clear that Pak bore the majority of the rent burden from April 2020 forward.

6. Brown accepted the office-sharing arrangement and acknowledged that he required Pak's continued occupancy to wind down his remaining cases.

7. On October 21, 2023, Brown ousted both Pak and Norris from the office without notice or cause, terminating their access to the space.


PAGE 10

I. Pak's Other Contributions and Financial Risk

The evidence at trial established that Pak had made substantial financial contributions to the firm over many years. Specifically:

1. Pak had assumed or covered various expenses of the firm, including:
   a. Payroll for office staff
   b. Court filing fees
   c. Expert witness fees
   d. Vendor payments
   e. Various other operating expenses

2. Pak had loaned money to the firm and had received credits for her contributions.

3. Pak had earned credits based on the firm's revenue and profits.

4. Pak undertook significant financial risk in her relationship with Brown and the firm.

5. The parties had an informal but understood arrangement whereby Pak would be reimbursed for her contributions and expenses through access to firm revenues and other benefits.

The Court finds that this long-standing pattern of financial contributions by Pak to the firm is relevant to evaluating the reasonableness of her conduct in authorizing and funding certain transactions during the period from 2019-2023.


PAGE 11

J. Contemporaneous Communications and Documents

The Court reviewed contemporaneous emails and documents related to these matters. The following are relevant:

1. Email communications between Pak and Brown regarding lead purchases and costs do not show Brown objecting to the purchases.

2. Bank statements clearly show the pattern of account usage, deposits, and withdrawals.

3. Accounting records maintained by Pak show the transactions in question.

4. No contemporaneous documents show Brown objecting to any of the lead purchases or requesting that Pak cease making such purchases.

5. Brown testified that he had access to these documents and reviewed them during the relevant period.

The Court notes that the documentary evidence regarding the exact timing and allocation of funds is somewhat incomplete, but the overall picture is clear: Brown was aware of and consented to the general use of firm accounts for lead purchases, and Pak believed she was acting within her authority in funding and directing these purchases.


PAGE 12

K. The Post-October 2023 Period

On October 21, 2023, Brown ousted Pak and Norris from the office without providing notice or explanation. After this date, Pak had no ability to access the office, the files, or the firm's accounts. Pak also had no ability to negotiate with the landlord or make any communications regarding the lease.

Following October 21, 2023, the landlord apparently made demands for rent payments. The lease obligations accelerated or ballooned following Brown's unilateral termination of the office arrangement.

The Court finds that any rent obligation arising after October 21, 2023, was caused by Brown's unilateral ouster of Pak and Norris from the office, not by Pak's conduct or decisions. Pak had no ability to mitigate or address the landlord's demands after October 21, 2023.


PAGE 13

L. The Expert Witness Testimony

Both parties retained experts in accounting and business practices. The Court heard testimony from experts regarding the proper accounting treatment of the transactions at issue, the normal business practices in law firms, and the reasonableness of various financial arrangements.

The Court found the expert testimony helpful but not determinative of the legal questions presented. The experts generally agreed that:

1. The manner in which Pak funded the lead purchases using her own deposits and credits was consistent with legitimate business practice.

2. The office-sharing arrangement and the allocation of rent payments were consistent with business practice for firms undergoing transitions.

3. The firm's accounting practices, while somewhat informal, were not unusual for a small law firm.

4. A reasonable business person in Pak's position might have concluded that she was acting within her authority to authorize and fund the lead purchases.

The Court notes that the expert testimony supports a finding that Pak's conduct was consistent with reasonable business practice and not necessarily indicative of disloyalty or wrongful intent.


PAGE 14

M. The Relationship Between Brown and Pak Post-2020

By 2020, the relationship between Brown and Pak had become more formal in some respects, but the Court finds that Brown continued to be aware of Pak's role in managing firm finances and her understanding that she had authority to make financial decisions regarding lead purchases and other operating expenses.

The Court also notes that:

1. Brown continued to trust Pak to manage firm operations.

2. Brown did not revoke or limit Pak's authority to make financial decisions.

3. Brown continued to review and accept the results of Pak's financial management.

4. Brown did not separate his personal finances from the firm's finances in any meaningful way.

5. The informality of the arrangement meant that it was reasonable for Pak to believe she had broad authority to make financial decisions on behalf of the firm.

The Court acknowledges that this informal arrangement created ambiguity regarding the scope of Pak's authority. However, the Court finds that Brown's conduct—his continued reliance on Pak, his continued review and acceptance of her decisions, and his failure to object to her actions—constitutes an implicit authorization or ratification of her conduct.


PAGE 15

N. The State Bar Matters and Brown's Knowledge

During the period from 2019-2023, Brown was the subject of a State Bar investigation and was facing suspension from practice. The evidence showed:

1. Brown was aware of the investigation and the potential suspension.

2. Brown discussed the investigation and suspension with some individuals (notably Pak), but did not disclose it to his wife initially.

3. The investigation and potential suspension were factors motivating Brown to wind down his practice and transition cases to Norris.

4. Brown's desire to wind down his practice was genuine and was communicated to multiple people, including Pak, Navarro, and others.

5. The State Bar matters provide context for understanding Brown's motivations regarding the practice transition.

The Court finds that Brown's knowledge of the State Bar investigation and the impending suspension supports the Court's finding that he knew he needed to wind down his practice and transition cases to another attorney.


PAGE 16

O. Pak's Beliefs Regarding Her Authority

The Court must assess Pak's state of mind regarding whether she believed she had authority to make the financial decisions at issue. The evidence showed:

1. Pak had a long history of making financial decisions for the firm.

2. Pak had made significant financial contributions to the firm.

3. Pak had earned credits and had an informal understanding that she had a stake in the firm's operations.

4. Pak had authority to manage client trust accounts and business accounts.

5. Pak had never been told by Brown that she lacked authority to make financial decisions regarding lead purchases or operating expenses.

6. The informal nature of the arrangement meant that the boundaries of Pak's authority were ambiguous.

7. Other employees and associates of the firm understood that Pak had significant authority and discretion over financial matters.

Based on this evidence, the Court finds that Pak may have believed that she had authority to make the financial decisions in question, or at least that she may have believed that the lead purchases and rent payments fell within the scope of expenses she was authorized to cover as part of her contribution to the firm.

The fact that Pak may have held a good faith belief regarding her authority is relevant to the assessment of her conduct and her intent.


PAGE 17

P. Brown's Competence and Capacity

Plaintiffs alleged that Brown is an elderly person who was vulnerable to elder abuse. Brown testified regarding his competence and his capacity to manage his affairs during the relevant period. The Court finds:

1. Brown is now 74 years old and was 69-70 years old during the 2019-2023 period.

2. Brown testified credibly regarding his memory, his ability to understand financial matters, and his capacity to make decisions.

3. Brown's testimony regarding his activities and decisions during the 2019-2023 period was generally coherent and consistent with other evidence.

4. Brown demonstrated knowledge of the firm's operations and financial matters.

5. Brown testified that he was handling his business affairs during the relevant period.

6. The evidence did not show any cognitive decline or incapacity on Brown's part during the 2019-2023 period.

7. Brown had the capacity to understand the nature and consequences of the financial transactions at issue.

The Court finds that Brown was competent and capable of managing his affairs and understanding the transactions that occurred during the 2019-2023 period.


PAGE 18

Q. Pak's Knowledge of Brown's Wife

The evidence also addressed what Pak knew regarding Brown's wife and whether Pak exploited any vulnerability related to Brown's relationship with his wife. The evidence showed:

1. Pak was aware that Brown had not disclosed the State Bar investigation and suspension to his wife.

2. Pak did eventually share information about the investigation and suspension with Brown's wife when she (the wife) was concerned about Brown's health during a hospitalization related to COVID-19.

3. Pak did not use this information as a threat or as a means to coerce or manipulate Brown.

4. The Court found no evidence that Pak attempted to exploit the marital relationship or use private information regarding Brown as a means of coercion.

5. The disclosure of the State Bar investigation to Brown's wife was prompted by the wife's legitimate health concerns, not by any bad faith motive on Pak's part.

The Court finds that Pak's conduct regarding the disclosure of information to Brown's wife does not constitute undue influence or bad faith conduct.


PAGE 19

R. Mrs. Brown's Testimony Regarding Lead Purchases

Mrs. Brown testified at trial that she was aware of the large lead purchases and that her husband told her they were a good business investment. Mrs. Brown claimed that she was skeptical of this explanation and thought the purchases were inadvisable.

Mrs. Brown also claims that she was aware that the Brown firm was purchasing leads in the amount of $635,000 in June 2019, which she thought was inadvisable. Her husband told her that it was a good business investment. (Id., at p. 169, ln. 17-170, ln. 22.) The Court found this testimony unlikely, given that her testimony was imprecise and she admitted that at this same time her husband was not telling her the truth about one key issue—that he was under investigation by the state bar and facing a one-year suspension. (TR 3/13/25, p. 133:8-26.)

Indeed, she only learned about the investigation and his suspension because Pak shared this information with her when Baird was hospitalized with Covid in 2022; Mrs. Brown acknowledged that because her husband was "embarrassed," he hid this information from her for three years. (Id.) She also indicated that she had no knowledge of her husband entering any kind of relationship with Norris, while it is undisputed from the records that Brown approved the substitution of Norris onto the Roh case (discussed below) and signed a written agreement to give him 20% of all of proceeds from the Androgel cases. Apparently, there was a lot of information that Baird did not share with his wife. She also testified that she was aware that her husband had been retained by the Mick family in 2014, but that her husband told her he was doing nothing on the case. (3/13/25 RT pp. 125-1 28.) This further supports the court's conclusion that Brown knew he needed another attorney to handle cases, the Mick case being just one of them.


PAGE 20

S. Brown's Wife's Awareness of Professional Matters

The evidence further established that:

1. Brown's wife was largely unaware of the details of Brown's law practice and financial arrangements.

2. Brown deliberately concealed information from his wife regarding his State Bar investigation and suspension.

3. Brown's wife did not have independent knowledge of the lead purchases or their amounts.

4. Brown's wife did not participate in financial decisions regarding the firm.

5. Brown's wife's testimony about what Brown told her is not a reliable indicator of what Brown actually knew or believed.

6. Brown deliberately withheld information from his wife about the Norris relationship and the transition of cases.

The Court finds that Brown's wife's testimony regarding what Brown told her should be given limited weight because she was deliberately kept uninformed by Brown regarding major professional developments. Her testimony reflects what Brown told her, not necessarily what he actually knew or the basis for his representations to her.


PAGE 21

T. The Transfer of Cases to Norris

By late 2019 and continuing through 2023, Brown transferred cases to Norris. The evidence shows:

1. Brown signed documents transferring cases to Norris, including the Roh case.

2. Brown signed a written agreement with Norris regarding fee-sharing on Androgel cases.

3. These documents were dated and showed that Brown understood the nature of the arrangements with Norris.

4. Brown participated actively in facilitating the transfer of cases to Norris.

5. The cases being transferred were mass tort cases that formed the primary basis for the original lead purchases at issue.

The Court finds that Brown's participation in the transfer of cases to Norris demonstrates that he understood the purpose of the practice transition and that he was actively involved in directing it.


PAGE 22

U. Norris and XYZ Legal's Conduct

The evidence at trial regarding Norris and XYZ Legal showed:

1. Norris was aware that he was receiving cases from Brown and working with Brown's firm on a transition arrangement.

2. Norris did not receive the lead purchases directly and did not control the funding for lead purchases.

3. Norris did not have access to Brown's client trust accounts or business accounts.

4. Norris did not direct or control Pak's financial decisions.

5. Norris did not have a pre-existing agreement with Pak regarding the lead purchases or the practice transition.

6. Norris knew that Pak was making financial decisions regarding the firm's operations.

7. Norris did not benefit from or encourage Pak to make unauthorized expenditures.

The evidence did not support a finding that Norris or XYZ Legal participated in any breach of fiduciary duty or any wrongful conduct toward Brown. Rather, Norris was a party to a legitimate transition arrangement initiated by Brown.


PAGE 23

V. The Office-Sharing Arrangement and Rent

The office-sharing arrangement in place from 2019-2023 included the following terms and understandings:

1. The office lease was in Brown's name, but Brown required Pak to occupy and maintain the space.

2. Pak used the office to manage administrative matters and to support the firm's transition.

3. Norris used the office to work on transitioned cases and support the firm's operations.

4. Rent payments were made by various parties at different times.

5. Pak paid the majority of rent from April 2020 through October 2023.

6. Norris contributed $15,000 toward rent during his period of occupancy.

7. Brown made no rent payments after April 2020 but remained on the lease.

8. The arrangement was reasonable and consistent with business practice during a practice transition.

9. Brown accepted and benefited from the arrangement and acknowledged that he required Pak's continued occupancy.

10. The exact accounting of rent payments among the parties is unclear from the documentary evidence, but the pattern is clear: Pak bore most of the rent burden.

The Court finds that the office-sharing arrangement was a reasonable business arrangement in light of the practice transition and that it was undertaken with Brown's knowledge and consent.


PAGE 24

W. Judge Recana's Prior Ruling on the Scope of Fiduciary Duty

The case was initially before Judge Recana, who issued a ruling regarding the scope of any fiduciary duty owed by Pak to Brown. Judge Recana found that:

1. A general fiduciary duty between Pak and Brown existed but was limited in time.

2. The general fiduciary duty ended on April 1, 2020, or was significantly narrowed at that point.

3. After April 1, 2020, any fiduciary duty was limited to specific matters related to personal injury cases that Brown retained.

4. Pak's role and authority after April 1, 2020, was more clearly defined as an employee rather than as a fiduciary.

The current court adopts Judge Recana's reasoning and ruling on this issue. The Court notes that this limitation on the scope of fiduciary duty significantly constrains the Plaintiffs' claims.


PAGE 25

X. Application of Fiduciary Duty Principles

Based on the foregoing findings of fact, the Court applies the following legal principles to the conduct at issue:

1. A fiduciary has a duty of loyalty and a duty to act in the best interests of the principal.

2. However, a fiduciary does not breach this duty if the principal has knowledge of the material facts and consents to the challenged conduct.

3. An implicit or ratified authorization by the principal constitutes consent.

4. A principal who reviews and accepts the results of a fiduciary's actions without objection may be deemed to have ratified those actions.

5. Where the principal has full access to information and the opportunity to object but does not do so, the principal may be deemed to have authorized the fiduciary's conduct.

6. The burden is on the Plaintiff to establish a breach of fiduciary duty by clear and convincing evidence.

Based on these principles and the facts found above, the Court must determine whether Pak breached her fiduciary duty to Brown regarding the lead purchases and rent payments.


PAGE 26

Y. The Lead Purchases: Pak's Funding and Authorization

With respect to the lead purchases, the Court finds that:

1. Pak funded most of the lead purchases with her own deposits and credits.

2. Pak had authority to manage the firm's financial accounts.

3. Pak believed, possibly incorrectly but in good faith, that she had authority to authorize the lead purchases.

4. Brown had full access to the financial information regarding these purchases.

5. Brown reviewed the accounts and records and did not object.

6. Brown's conduct in reviewing and not objecting constitutes an implicit authorization or ratification of the purchases.

7. Pak did not conceal the use of these funds from Brown.

8. Brown knew the general purpose of the lead purchases—that they were for use by the firm in developing a mass tort practice or for use by Norris in the transitioning practice.

9. Pak may have believed that the lead purchases and the funding of such purchases fell within the scope of the reimbursement arrangement between her and Brown.

Given these findings, the Court must now determine the legal consequences of Pak's conduct.


PAGE 27

Z. Findings Regarding Breach of Fiduciary Duty

The Court makes the following findings regarding breach of fiduciary duty:

1. Pak had a fiduciary duty to Brown that was limited in scope and duration as established in Judge Recana's prior ruling.

2. Pak may have exceeded the scope of her authority in authorizing and funding certain lead purchases, particularly with respect to purchases after the initial transition was clear.

3. The documentation of Pak's authority and the scope of the parties' agreement regarding Pak's role was insufficient.

4. However, the evidence does not establish a clear breach of the duty of loyalty, as Brown had knowledge of and consented to the general use of firm funds for lead purchases.

5. Brown reviewed the transactions and raised no objections.

6. Pak did not conceal the use of these funds from Brown.

7. Brown knew that Pak was purchasing leads and for what general purpose.

8. Although Brown may not have known that leads were being purchased specifically for Norris (as opposed to the Baird firm), the evidence establishes that he knew the leads were not being purchased for his personal use.

9. Pak may have believed that she was acting within the scope of her authority and within the long-standing reimbursement arrangement between her and Brown.

10. Brown made no rent payments after April 2020, which suggests that he agreed to offset his rent obligation against Pak's contributions to rent.

11. Pak's conduct was at most negligent in its failure to more clearly establish and document the authorization for the lead purchases.

The Court therefore finds that Pak's conduct constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to certain of the lead purchases, specifically those occurring after June 2019 when the Norris transition was clearly underway.

AA. Findings Regarding Damages for Breach of Fiduciary Duty

With respect to damages for breach of fiduciary duty, the Court makes the following findings:

1. The measure of damages for breach of fiduciary duty is the actual harm to the principal resulting from the breach.

2. With respect to the lead purchases, the Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing the amount of harm resulting from Pak's conduct.

3. Plaintiffs presented evidence of the total amounts of the lead purchases ($418,500 total with the four transactions identified).

4. However, Plaintiffs did not establish that all of these amounts constitute a loss to Brown.

5. Pak funded or credited a significant portion of these purchases with her own deposits and credits.

6. The leads purchased were for use by the firm, either by Brown or by Norris in the transitioned practice.

7. The evidence does not establish that Brown did not benefit from at least some of the leads purchased.

8. Plaintiffs failed to establish that the leads purchased were worthless or that Brown was harmed by the purchasing of leads for the transitioned practice with Norris.

9. With respect to rent, Plaintiffs failed to establish that they incurred rent liability after Pak's alleged breach or that such liability was caused by Pak's conduct.

10. Plaintiffs failed to establish that Pak caused any rent obligation to attach to Brown, Pak, or Norris that would not have otherwise attached.

No wrongful taking of clients, fees, or office resources occurred, and the award is as follows for breach of fiduciary duty.


PAGE 29

BB. Findings Regarding Elder Financial Abuse

The Court now addresses the claim for elder financial abuse under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 15610.30. Elder financial abuse requires:

1. A wrongful taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining of property;

2. Belonging to an elder or dependent adult;

3. By a caregiver or person in a fiduciary relationship;

4. With intent to defraud or knowing that the conduct is likely to harm the elder;

5. Or through undue influence.

The Court makes the following findings:

1. Brown is an elder as defined by statute (now 74, was 69-70 during the relevant events).

2. Pak had a fiduciary relationship with Brown as established above.

3. Pak's conduct regarding the lead purchases and rent payments constitutes a taking or secreting of property as defined by statute.

4. The taking was with knowledge or recklessness regarding the likelihood of harm to Brown, or through undue influence.

5. The conduct was wrongful in the sense required by statute.

The Court therefore finds that Pak's conduct constitutes elder financial abuse as defined by statute.


PAGE 30

CC. Findings Regarding Norris and Liability

With respect to Norris, the Court makes the following findings:

1. Norris was not a caregiver and did not have a fiduciary relationship with Brown.

2. Norris did not take or secrete property belonging to Brown.

3. Norris did not participate in any wrongful taking of property.

4. Norris did not exercise undue influence over Brown.

5. Norris did not know the source of the funds used to purchase the leads.

6. Norris did not participate in or encourage Pak's conduct regarding the lead purchases.

7. Norris was aware that he was benefiting from the lead purchases to the extent that leads were purchased for his use in the transitioned practice.

8. However, Norris did not direct, authorize, or encourage Pak to use any particular source of funds for the lead purchases.

9. Norris did not have access to Brown's client trust accounts or business accounts.

10. Norris's receipt of benefits from the transitioned practice does not make him liable for Pak's conduct.

The Court therefore finds that Norris is not liable for breach of fiduciary duty, elder financial abuse, conversion, or any other cause of action related to the lead purchases or the practice transition.


PAGE 31

DD. The Damages Award for Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Elder Financial Abuse

Based on the findings above, the Court determines the appropriate damages award. The Court must determine the actual harm to Brown resulting from Pak's conduct.

With respect to the lead purchases:

1. Plaintiffs asserted that all $418,500 of the questioned transactions constitute damages.

2. However, the evidence establishes that Pak funded a significant portion of these purchases with her own deposits and credits.

3. The evidence establishes that the leads purchased were for use by the firm or for the firm's practice transition.

4. The evidence does not establish that Brown did not benefit from at least some of the leads purchased.

5. Taking into account Pak's funding and credits toward the lead purchases, the net loss to Brown is less than the gross amount of the purchases.

6. Applying the evidence regarding Pak's funding and credits, the Court awards damages for breach of fiduciary duty and elder financial abuse related to the lead purchases in the amount of $188,500.

This amount represents the questionable lead purchase transactions that are not fully explained or reimbursed by Pak's own credits and deposits.


PAGE 32

EE. Damages for Rent-Related Claims

With respect to rent, the Court makes the following findings:

1. Brown made rent payments until April 2020 and then ceased making rent payments.

2. Pak made rent payments thereafter.

3. Norris contributed $15,000 toward rent.

4. The exact amount of rent obligations during the period in question is not entirely clear from the evidence presented.

5. The office-sharing arrangement was undertaken with Brown's knowledge and consent.

6. Brown required Pak to continue to occupy the office to wind down his remaining cases.

7. The rent payments made by Pak were made in connection with her use of the office for winding down the firm's business and supporting the practice transition.

8. Any rent obligation that accrued after October 21, 2023, was caused by Brown's unilateral ouster of Pak and Norris, not by Pak's conduct.

9. Plaintiffs failed to establish with specificity what rent obligation, if any, Brown incurred that was caused by Pak's conduct.

10. Taking into account the various contributions toward rent and the offsetting benefit to Brown from Pak's use of the office to wind down his remaining cases, the Court awards damages for rent in the amount of $24,000.


PAGE 33

FF. Prejudgment Interest

The Court awards prejudgment interest on the judgment as follows:

1. Prejudgment interest accrues on the judgment amount at the rate set by statute.

2. The accrual period begins from the date that Pak's alleged wrongful conduct occurred.

3. Given the ongoing nature of the transactions, the Court finds that prejudgment interest should accrue from the latest transaction giving rise to liability.

4. Prejudgment interest is awarded in accordance with California Civil Code Section 3287.

The amount of prejudgment interest will be calculated from the date specified in the judgment.


PAGE 34

GG. Attorney's Fees and Costs

Under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 15657.5, a court may award attorney's fees to a plaintiff in an elder financial abuse case where the plaintiff prevails.

The Court makes the following findings:

1. Plaintiffs are the prevailing party with respect to the elder financial abuse claim.

2. Plaintiffs' counsel has submitted evidence regarding the reasonable attorney's fees incurred in this matter.

3. The time entries and billing rates are reasonable.

4. The amount of attorney's fees claimed is reasonable in light of the complexity of the matter and the time required to litigate it.

The Court awards attorney's fees to Plaintiffs in the amount of $[AMOUNT TO BE DETERMINED BY COURT] in accordance with Section 15657.5.

The Court also awards Plaintiffs their costs of suit in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 1032.

The costs award includes filing fees, service of process costs, expert witness fees, and other costs reasonably incurred in connection with this litigation.


PAGE 35

HH. Findings Regarding the Breach of Fiduciary Duty Cause of Action

With respect to the breach of fiduciary duty claim:

1. The Court has found that Pak breached her fiduciary duty to Brown with respect to certain of the lead purchases.

2. The scope of the fiduciary duty was limited as established by Judge Recana's prior ruling.

3. The fiduciary duty ended on April 1, 2020, with respect to the general management of the firm.

4. After April 1, 2020, any fiduciary duty was limited to specific matters related to cases Brown retained.

5. Pak's conduct regarding the lead purchases that occurred after Brown's knowledge of the Norris transition and after the scope of her authority had been narrowed constitutes a breach of this limited fiduciary duty.

6. However, the finding of breach is tempered by the fact that Brown had knowledge of and did not object to the general nature of the lead purchases and their intended use.

The Court therefore finds Pak liable for breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the lead purchases, and the damages award is as set forth above.


PAGE 36

II. Liability of Norris and XYZ Legal

The Court makes the following findings with respect to Norris and XYZ Legal:

1. Norris and XYZ Legal are not liable for breach of fiduciary duty because they did not owe a fiduciary duty to Brown.

2. Norris and XYZ Legal are not liable for elder financial abuse because Norris is not a caregiver or person in a fiduciary relationship with Brown, and XYZ Legal is a business entity that did not exercise undue influence or engage in wrongful taking.

3. Norris and XYZ Legal are not liable for conversion because they did not take possession of Brown's property with intent to deprive him of it.

4. Norris and XYZ Legal are not liable for any other cause of action because the evidence does not establish that they participated in or encouraged any wrongful conduct by Pak.

5. Norris did not have knowledge that the lead purchases were funded with Brown's client trust account funds or business account funds.

6. The receipt of leads as a result of the practice transition does not constitute wrongful conduct by Norris.

The Court therefore finds Norris and XYZ Legal not liable on all causes of action brought against them.


PAGE 37

PAGE 38

KK. Findings of Fact Regarding Pak's Knowledge

The Court makes additional findings regarding Pak's knowledge and intent:

1. Pak knew that she was using client trust account funds and business account funds for the lead purchases.

2. Pak believed, possibly incorrectly, that she had authority to use these funds for this purpose.

3. Pak did not conceal the lead purchases from Brown.

4. Pak did not conceal the fact that she was funding or crediting the purchases with her own deposits and credits.

5. Pak was aware that Brown was winding down his practice and transitioning cases to Norris.

6. Pak understood the general business purpose of the lead purchases.

7. Pak believed that she was acting within the scope of her authority and within the long-standing reimbursement arrangement with Brown.

8. Pak did not intend to defraud Brown or to cause harm to Brown.

9. Pak's actions were taken in the context of a long-standing informal business relationship with significant ambiguity regarding the scope of her authority.

These findings are relevant to the characterization of Pak's conduct as negligent rather than intentional or reckless.


PAGE 39

LL. Findings Regarding Causation and Harm

The Court makes the following findings regarding causation and harm:

1. The lead purchases were made in the context of Brown's decision to wind down his practice and transition cases to Norris.

2. The harm to Brown, if any, from the lead purchases relates to the source of funds used and the allocation of the costs.

3. The office-sharing arrangement and the rent payments were undertaken with Brown's knowledge and consent.

4. The harm to Brown, if any, from the rent-related conduct relates to the allocation of rent payment obligations among the parties.

5. Brown made no rent payments after April 2020, suggesting that he agreed to offset his rent obligation against Pak's contributions.

6. The primary harm alleged is the amount of funds used for lead purchases and the amount of rent paid by Pak rather than by Brown.

7. Plaintiffs failed to establish that the leads purchased were worthless or useless to Brown or the firm.

8. Plaintiffs failed to establish any quantifiable harm to Brown beyond the alleged misuse of funds.

The Court's damage awards reflect an attempt to balance the evidence regarding the actual harm to Brown.


PAGE 40

MM. Findings Regarding Undue Influence

With respect to the claim of undue influence as a basis for elder financial abuse:

1. Undue influence requires that a person exercise excessive persuasion over an elder such that the elder's free will is overcome.

2. The evidence does not establish that Pak exercised excessive persuasion over Brown.

3. Brown was competent and capable of making his own decisions.

4. Brown reviewed the financial transactions and made his own decisions regarding the practice transition.

5. Brown was not dependent on Pak in the sense required for undue influence.

6. Brown had full access to information and the ability to question Pak's actions.

7. Brown did not defer to Pak's judgment in a way that would constitute undue influence.

8. The informal nature of their relationship does not equate to undue influence.

However, the Court finds that the informal arrangement and the ambiguity regarding the scope of Pak's authority, combined with the financial risk Pak undertook and her significant role in managing the firm's finances, created a situation in which Pak may have acted beyond the scope of her actual authority, even if not with intent to defraud or exercise undue influence.


PAGE 41

NN. Final Determinations

The Court makes the following final determinations:

1. The scope of Pak's fiduciary duty was limited in time and scope, as established by Judge Recana's prior ruling.

2. Pak exceeded the scope of her actual authority in certain respects regarding the lead purchases.

3. However, Brown's knowledge of and failure to object to the lead purchases constitutes an implicit authorization or ratification of at least some of Pak's conduct.

4. Pak's conduct was at most negligent rather than intentional, fraudulent, or involving undue influence.

5. The actual harm to Brown from Pak's conduct is less than the amounts Plaintiffs claimed.

6. Norris and XYZ Legal did not participate in or encourage Pak's conduct and are not liable.

7. The appropriate remedy is a damages award that reflects the actual harm to Brown resulting from Pak's conduct, rather than the full amount of the questioned transactions.

8. Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs because they prevailed on the elder financial abuse claim.

9. The judgment should provide Pak with credit for her substantial contributions toward the lead purchases and rent payments.

10. The judgment reflects a finding that Pak's conduct, while exceeding the scope of her actual authority, did not constitute intentional wrongdoing, fraud, or undue influence.

OO. Conclusion

For all of the reasons set forth in this Statement of Decision, the Court has found:

1. Michelle Pak is liable for breach of fiduciary duty to Baird Brown and Nina Brown in the amount of $188,500, plus prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.

2. Michelle Pak is liable for elder financial abuse under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 15610.30 in the same amount, with the same additional remedies.

3. Asher Norris and XYZ Legal are not liable for any of the claims brought against them.

4. The judgment is entered in accordance with the findings and determinations set forth above.

This Statement of Decision is issued pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 632 and constitutes the Court's explanation of its decision in this matter.

The Court acknowledges the complexity of the matter and the effort of all counsel in presenting their cases. However, the clear findings established through the evidence—particularly regarding Brown's knowledge, his review of transactions, his failure to object, his participation in the practice transition, and the substantial contributions made by Pak toward the questioned expenses—compel the conclusion that Pak's conduct, while exceeding her actual authority in some respects, does not constitute the type of serious wrongdoing that would justify holding Pak responsible for all of the amounts claimed by Plaintiffs.

The judgment reflects a balancing of these factors and an award of damages that is proportionate to the actual harm established by the evidence.
