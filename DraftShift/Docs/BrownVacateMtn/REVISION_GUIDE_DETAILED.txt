REVISION GUIDE: Detailed Change-by-Change Analysis
====================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The revised motion integrates three powerful new arguments while eliminating redundancies, staying well within the 15-page limit. Total estimated page savings: ~2 pages, with ~1.25 pages of new, devastating arguments strategically inserted.

====================================================================
SECTION-BY-SECTION BREAKDOWN
====================================================================

I. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
-----------------------
ORIGINAL: 1 paragraph (brief intro to § 663 framework)

CHANGES MADE:
✓ Added explicit reference to Mrs. Brown's testimony being "unlikely" and "imprecise"
✓ Added statement that Plaintiffs' "core claim" (Brown didn't know leads were for Norris) is "not a factual finding at all"
✓ Added pointer to rent award lacking findings ("no finding that Plaintiffs paid rent after October 21, 2023")
✓ Integrated the three new arguments into the opening, signaling to the judge what's coming
✓ Maintained the original legal framework language for continuity

PAGES AFFECTED: ~0.25 pages added (mostly by tightening language elsewhere)
IMPACT: The summary now immediately flags all three devastating points, rather than making the judge wait until later sections.

----

II. LEGAL STANDARD
-------------------
ORIGINAL: 2 paragraphs of boilerplate § 663 law
CHANGES: KEPT ENTIRELY AS WRITTEN

Reason: This section is clean, focused, and legally necessary. No redundancy.

----

III. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT A JUDGMENT FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESTRUCTURED FROM 6 SUBSECTIONS (A-F) TO 7 SUBSECTIONS (A-G)

SUBSECTION A (NEW): "Plaintiffs' Sole 'Fact' Is Not a Factual Finding—It Is an Unsupported Conclusion"

WHAT THIS DOES:
This is one of the three new power arguments. It leads with the most devastating point: the sentence Plaintiffs rely on ("Brown didn't know leads were for Norris") is NOT a factual finding. The surrounding text contains ZERO factual findings supporting it. The Court couldn't even find a reasonable explanation for the source of funds—that's not a finding of wrongdoing, it's a gap.

KEY ELEMENTS:
• Opens by naming Plaintiffs' exact argument
• Explains the difference between conclusions and findings
• Shows the SOD says "could not find reasonable explanation" (a gap, not a finding)
• Lists SEVEN actual findings that contradict the conclusion
• Applies § 663 principle: conclusions can't support judgments; findings must

PAGES: 0.75 pages
PLACEMENT: Leads the entire breach-of-duty analysis
STRATEGIC VALUE: This is your offensive move. You're not defending—you're dismantling their core claim before they even fully present it.

---

SUBSECTION B (ORIGINAL A, RENAMED): "The SOD Limits the Scope of Any Fiduciary Duty"

CHANGES MADE:
✓ KEPT ENTIRELY AS WRITTEN (strong argument, no redundancy)
✓ Moved to position B (was position A)

PAGES: 0.25 pages
NOTE: This argument works well immediately after the "core finding is not a finding" point because it shows the Court also narrowed the scope to 2020—so even if there were a breach, it would be cabined.

---

SUBSECTION C (NEW): "Mrs. Brown's Testimony—Plaintiffs' Strongest Evidence—Was Expressly Rejected by the Court as 'Unlikely' and 'Imprecise'"

WHAT THIS DOES:
This is the second of the three new power arguments. It's the smoking gun. Plaintiffs are citing testimony that the Court explicitly found unreliable. But you're not arguing anything new—you're simply quoting the Court's own credibility determination.

KEY ELEMENTS:
• Quotes the SOD's exact language: "unlikely" and "imprecise"
• Lists seven categories of information Brown concealed from her (patterns, not gaps)
• Shows the Court used her testimony to prove the OPPOSITE of what Plaintiffs claim
• Explains the logic: Brown controlled information flow, which proves he understood the transition
• Applies § 663: "A judgment cannot rest on testimony the Court expressly found not credible"

PAGES: 0.5 pages
PLACEMENT: Early in the fiduciary-duty analysis, right after the narrow scope point
STRATEGIC VALUE: This is your defensive move—you're showing the judge that Plaintiffs' attempts to resurrect rejected testimony violate § 663. It's clean, devastating, and requires no speculation.

---

SUBSECTION D (ORIGINAL B, CONDENSED, RENAMED): "The Court's Findings Establish Brown's Knowledge, Consent, and Participation"

CHANGES MADE:
✓ REMOVED all reference to Pak's funding (consolidated elsewhere—see note below)
✓ Tightened language to focus purely on Brown's knowledge/consent/participation
✓ Kept the legal principle: "Conduct undertaken with the principal's knowledge and in furtherance of the principal's expressed objectives cannot constitute a breach"
✓ Removed redundant "Brown was competent" language (now established in Section III.A)

PAGES: 0.5 pages (down from 0.75 in original)
SAVINGS: 0.25 pages

NOTE ON PAK'S FUNDING: Rather than listing it here, you now mention it once in Section VI.A and cross-reference it. This eliminates the problem of repeating the same funding details across three different sections (original B, original D, and original V.E).

---

SUBSECTION E (ORIGINAL C, CONDENSED, RENAMED): "Navarro's 'Extremely Credible and Even Guileless' Testimony Confirms Brown's Active Participation"

CHANGES MADE:
✓ Tightened from original to focus on Navarro as confirmation (not deep dive)
✓ Kept the core legal principle about consent defeating breach
✓ Removed the phrase "and it does not find that she was prescient" (moved to Section IV)
✓ Cut the lengthy quote structure; now paraphrase with one clear cite

PAGES: 0.3 pages (down from 0.5 in original)
SAVINGS: 0.2 pages

RATIONALE: Navarro is important but you've now introduced her in the NEW Section III.C (Mrs. Brown rejection) and you have her full credibility discussion in Section IV (Footnote 4). So this section just needs to remind the judge of the key finding (Brown was discussing retirement, introduced Norris, etc.) and cite the legal principle. Don't repeat.

---

SUBSECTION F (ORIGINAL E, UNCHANGED): "The SOD's Conditional Findings Create Fatal Ambiguity Under CCP §634"

CHANGES: KEPT AS WRITTEN

PAGES: 0.35 pages
REASON: This argument is unique, legally precise, and doesn't overlap with anything else. It deserves full space.

---

SUBSECTION G (ORIGINAL F, UNCHANGED): "The Findings Do Not Establish Causation or Damages"

CHANGES: KEPT AS WRITTEN

PAGES: 0.2 pages
REASON: Clean, final point in the fiduciary-duty section. No redundancy.

---

SECTION III TOTAL:
Original: ~2.5 pages
Revised: ~2.75 pages
Net Change: +0.25 pages (acceptable because this is where the new power arguments go)

But note: This is offset by tighter language in the new Subsections D & E (savings of ~0.45 pages) plus the consolidation of Pak's funding details.

====================================================================

IV. THE COURT'S INDEPENDENT FINDING IN FOOTNOTE 4 FORECLOSES LIABILITY UNDER BOTH CAUSES OF ACTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL: ~0.5 pages
CHANGES:
✓ Very slightly tightened for conciseness
✓ Kept the core finding intact
✓ Removed one redundant phrase ("negate unauthorized conduct..." is stated both before and after the quote; kept only the after version)

PAGES: 0.4 pages (saved 0.1)
REASON: This section is already focused. The tightening is just trim, not structural.

====================================================================

V. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT THE ELDER FINANCIAL ABUSE JUDGMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------

RESTRUCTURED AND CONDENSED

KEY CHANGE #1: REMOVED THE OPENING PARAGRAPH THAT REPEATED FIDUCIARY-DUTY FINDINGS
Original opened with: "The SOD's findings negate every statutory element including wrongful taking, intent to defraud, undue influence, knowledge of harm, and causation, and instead established that Brown was competent, informed, consenting, and actively participating..."

REVISED: Now opens directly with subsection headings and delegates readers to Section III via cross-reference for the competence/consent findings.

REASON: You've already established competence, consent, and participation in detail in Section III. No need to repeat it here. Elder abuse is a separate claim with separate statutory elements. By cross-referencing, you show the structure while saving space.

PAGES SAVED: ~0.3 pages

KEY CHANGE #2: CONDENSED SUBSECTIONS A-D (ORIGINAL AND REVISED)

✓ Subsection A: Kept but tightened (removed one redundant case cite)
✓ Subsection B: Consolidated the "no wrongful taking/intent/undue influence" findings into one tighter paragraph (removed repetitive structure). Removed phrase "The Court also found that no wrongful taking of clients, fees, or office resources occurred and awarded no elder-abuse damages" because it's repetitive with the "Court found no wrongful taking" statement. SAVINGS: 0.1 pages
✓ Subsection C: Kept as written but shortened the opening line about elements of undue influence (moved the full definition to the original § 15610.70 code section reference without repeating it)
✓ Subsection D: Kept as written (it's concise)

KEY CHANGE #3: SUBSECTION E (ORIGINAL E)
Kept the structure but removed one redundant phrase about "wrongful taking, wrongful use, and harm" being required—you've already stated this multiple times. Now just says "These findings negate deprivation of property, wrongful use, and harm." SAVINGS: 0.05 pages

KEY CHANGE #4: SUBSECTION F (CONSOLIDATED FROM ORIGINAL)
Original Section V ended with a sentence like "When the SOD is read as a whole... negate every element... must be vacated." This is now Subsection F, condensed to one focused paragraph. KEPT AS WRITTEN because it's already the conclusion.

SECTION V TOTAL:
Original: ~2.5 pages
Revised: ~1.8 pages
NET SAVINGS: ~0.7 pages ✓ This is where you gain major space!

====================================================================

VI. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT THE DAMAGES AWARDS
----------------------------------------------------

SUBSECTION A: THE $188,500 LEAD-PURCHASE AWARD

MAJOR RESTRUCTURING:

Original structure:
• Opened with details of the $13,500 May 31 transaction
• Then discussed August 19 and October 22 transactions
• Then listed Pak's funding details at length
• Then discussed Norris exoneration
• Then conclusion

Revised structure:
• Opens with "Pak funded most of the purchases" (one sentence, cross-reference to Section VI for detailed breakdown)
• Quickly pivots to "August/October transactions have only documentation gaps" (not wrongdoing)
• Keeps the legal principle: "Documentation gaps do not constitute wrongful taking"
• Brown reviewed and consented = complete defense (condensed)
• Conditional "may have believed" language (brief reference to § 634)
• Norris exoneration (kept—this is powerful)
• Conclusion

PAGES SAVED: ~0.4 pages (condensed from ~1.5 pages to ~1.1 pages)

KEY CUT #1: Removed the lengthy breakdown of transaction amounts ($195,000 on May 14, $35,000 on May 31, etc.). This is detail that doesn't matter under § 663—the point is that the findings don't support the award, not the exact accounting. You cite the page numbers; if the judge wants the detail, she can read the SOD.

KEY CUT #2: Removed the phrase "The evidence shows that Pak primarily used her own money, not Brown's, to make most of the purchases in 2019." This is argumentative and close to reweighing evidence. Better to say "The SOD found that Ms. Pak funded most purchases" and let the findings speak.

KEY CUT #3: Tightened the discussion of Pak's "earnings credit of $100,000" to a single parenthetical rather than a full-sentence discussion.

PAGES: Revised: ~1.1 pages

---

SUBSECTION B: THE $24,000 RENT AWARD

THIS IS THE THIRD NEW POWER ARGUMENT (MAJOR REVISION)

Original structure:
• Discussed Brown's nonpayment (April 2020)
• Discussed that Pak paid most rent
• Discussed consent to office-sharing
• Discussed Brown's ouster of Pak/Norris
• Discussed offset
• Conclusion

Revised structure:
• LEADS with the killing blow: "The SOD contains NO FINDING that Plaintiffs paid rent after October 21, 2023, nor any finding that Ms. Pak caused any nonpayment."
• Then applies § 663 principle directly: "Without such findings, the rent damages award is unsupported as a matter of law"
• Then provides supporting facts:
  - Brown made no payments after April 2020
  - Pak paid most, Norris paid $15,000
  - Brown consented
  - Brown caused the ouster
  - Offset principle
• Conclusion

KEY CHANGE: You now open with the legal standard (§ 663 requires findings, not assumptions) and immediately show the gap (no finding of rent payment post-October 2023, no finding of causation by Pak). This is structurally much stronger than the original, which buried the point.

PAGES: Tightened from ~0.75 pages to ~0.5 pages (because you removed some redundant language about "consent bars liability" that was already covered in subsection C of the damages section)

NET SAVINGS: ~0.25 pages

COMBINED SECTIONS VI.A & VI.B CHANGES:
Original: ~2.25 pages
Revised: ~1.6 pages
NET SAVINGS: ~0.65 pages ✓

---

SUBSECTION C: INTEREST, ATTORNEY'S FEES, COSTS

Original: ~1 page
Revised: Kept as written with minor tightening of one redundant phrase

PAGES: ~0.9 pages (0.1 pages saved)

SECTION VI TOTAL:
Original: ~3.25 pages
Revised: ~2.5 pages
NET SAVINGS: ~0.75 pages ✓

====================================================================

VII. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED
--------------------------------------

ORIGINAL: Conclusion paragraph + prayer for relief
CHANGES: KEPT AS WRITTEN (this is tight and well-structured)

PAGES: ~0.5 pages

====================================================================

====================================================================

THE THREE NEW POWER ARGUMENTS - EXACT LOCATIONS
=================================================

1. "PLAINTIFFS' SOLE 'FACT' IS NOT A FACTUAL FINDING"
   Location: Section III.A (NEW)
   Pages: 0.75
   Summary: Plaintiffs claim "Brown didn't know leads were for Norris" but this is a conclusion with ZERO supporting findings. The SOD actually contains findings that contradict it.
   Impact: Immediately dismantles their core claim before they can weaponize it.

2. "MRS. BROWN'S TESTIMONY WAS EXPRESSLY REJECTED"
   Location: Section III.C (NEW)
   Pages: 0.5
   Summary: The SOD found her testimony "unlikely" and "imprecise." She was unaware of suspension, case transfers, Norris relationship, etc. The Court used her lack of knowledge to prove Brown understood the transition, not the opposite.
   Impact: Neutralizes their anecdotal "best fact" by showing the Court already rejected it.

3. "THE SOD CONTAINS NO FINDING THAT PLAINTIFFS PAID RENT POST-OCTOBER 2023"
   Location: Section VI.B (REVISED, with new lead paragraph)
   Pages: 0.5
   Summary: No finding of rent payment after the cut-off date. No finding that Pak caused any nonpayment. Therefore, the $24,000 award is unsupported as a matter of law.
   Impact: The rent award collapses because the factual findings don't exist.

====================================================================

HOW THE NEW ARGUMENTS FIT INTO § 663 STRUCTURE
================================================

The beauty of these three arguments is that they are pure § 663:

• Argument 1: Shows a conclusion lacks factual support (core § 663 violation)
• Argument 2: Shows testimony the Court rejected is being cited (credibility issue resolved by the SOD)
• Argument 3: Shows a damages award lacks supporting findings (core § 663 violation)

None of them ask the Court to reweigh evidence, reconsider facts, or change credibility determinations. They simply point to what the Court already decided and show that the judgment doesn't follow from those findings.

====================================================================

REDUNDANCIES ELIMINATED - DETAILED LIST
========================================

1. PAK'S FUNDING DETAILS
   Original problem: Mentioned in Section III.D, then again in Section IV, then again in Section V.E
   Solution: Consolidated to ONE mention in Section III.A, with cross-references elsewhere
   Savings: ~0.5 pages

2. BROWN'S COMPETENCE/KNOWLEDGE/CONSENT
   Original problem: Stated in Section III.B, then partially restated in Section III.D, then again in Section IV, then again in Section V
   Solution: Established fully in Section III.A (with Section III.B narrowing scope), then referenced via cross-reference in Section V
   Savings: ~0.4 pages

3. "CCP § 634 CONDITIONAL FINDINGS" DOCTRINE
   Original problem: Appeared in Section III.E and again in Section V.B
   Solution: Kept in Section III.F (now stands alone in fiduciary duty), brief reference in VI.A
   Savings: ~0.15 pages

4. NAVARRO TESTIMONY
   Original problem: Discussed in Section III.C, then cited in Section IV, then discussed again in Section V.D
   Solution: Full discussion in NEW Section III.C (where it naturally belongs—it's testimony), then just brief cite in Section V
   Savings: ~0.3 pages

5. "JUDGMENT MUST FOLLOW FINDINGS" PRINCIPLE
   Original problem: Restated in the intro to Sections II, III, IV, V, VI
   Solution: Established in Section II (Legal Standard), then assumed throughout
   Savings: ~0.25 pages

6. REPETITIVE § 15610.30 ELEMENT LISTING
   Original problem: Full statute cited and explained in Section V.A, then elements listed again in V.B, V.C, V.D
   Solution: Full explanation in V.A, then targeted references ("Section 15610.30 requires...") in later subsections
   Savings: ~0.15 pages

====================================================================

WHAT STAYS EXACTLY AS WRITTEN (NO CHANGES)
=============================================

These sections are tight, focused, and non-redundant:
• Section II (Legal Standard) - boilerplate but necessary
• Section IV (Footnote 4 Finding) - precise and singular point
• Section V.A (Fiduciary Breach ≠ Elder Abuse) - important doctrinal point, cited once
• Section V.F (Findings Negate Every Element) - conclusion of elder abuse argument
• Section VI.C (Interest, Fees, Costs) - detailed statutory analysis that doesn't repeat
• Section VII (Conclusion) - clear prayer for relief

These comprise ~2 pages of the revised motion and represent the "backbone" of the argument. Everything else is either consolidated, condensed, or newly inserted with surgical precision.

====================================================================

PROOFREADING NOTES
===================

The revised motion uses these symbols that may need correction:
• "§" (section symbol) - may appear as "?" in some systems; replace with "§"
• "—" (em dash) - may appear as "-" in some systems
• "'" (curly quotes) - may appear as straight quotes "'"
• ""  (curly quotes) - may appear as straight quotes ""

These are formatting issues only and don't affect the argument. When you finalize for filing, convert to the format your court requires (usually plain ASCII or specific Word formatting).

====================================================================

STRATEGIC SUMMARY FOR THE JUDGE
=================================

When the judge reads the revised motion, here's what she experiences:

1. SUMMARY: Learns upfront that there are THREE major problems:
   - A conclusion with no factual support
   - Testimony that was already rejected
   - A damages award lacking findings

2. SECTION III: Sees the architecture of your argument:
   - Lead with the unsupported conclusion (A)
   - Narrow the duty's scope anyway (B)
   - Show the rejected testimony (C)
   - Show Brown's knowledge/consent (D)
   - Show Navarro confirmed it (E)
   - Show the conditions language prevents implied findings (F)
   - Show no causation/damages anyway (G)

3. SECTION IV: Learns the Court's own footnote forecloses both causes of action

4. SECTION V: Applies all those findings to elder abuse statutory elements (already established, now just applied)

5. SECTION VI: Shows damages unsupported AND shows the rent finding gap

6. CONCLUSION: Requests vacation with clear alternatives

The motion never asks the judge to change her mind. It shows her that HER OWN FINDINGS don't support the judgment. That's the power of § 663, and this revision emphasizes it relentlessly.

====================================================================
