28 claimed that Brown came into the office once a month or once every other month and reviewed 
the bills and rent statements, which was consistent with Baird Brown and his wife's testimony 
about his regular practices. (RT 1/27/25, p. 72:21-73:6.) She claims that every checkshe wrote 
on this account was approved by Brown. (RT 2/14/25 RT at p. 28:20-29:5.) Later inher 
testimony, she conceded that for checks she wrote, she did not get pre-approval but she would 
answer Brown's questions if he had any. (Id., at p. 29: 17-25.) 
The Brown firm had a five-year lease for office space at 3055 Wilshire Blvd. (Exh. 19), 
which commenced April I, 2019, with monthly rental payments of approximately $3000 per 
month with scheduled increases. Monthly rent was paid out of Brown's operating expenses. (RT 
1/27/25, p. 56: 1 to 57:22 and Exhibit 19.) In 2019, Michelle Pak signed the checks, paying their 
monthly office lease out of Brown's operating account (See Exh. 7, p. 43, check No. 6914.) Pak 
identified her signature on Check No. 6914, which the court finds to be a distinctive signature 
and quite different than Baird Brown's signature, which also appeared on checks written off the 
operating account. Pak was still writing checks for rent and office parking spaces to the 
buildings' owners and Standard Parking out of the Brown operating account throughout 2020, as 
well as numerou s other checks. (1/27/25, p. 62:1-28 and Exh. 10.) Brown ceased to write 
checks on the Operating Account sometime in 2020. (See Exh. 9.) Pak continued to pay the rent 
using Brown's operating account throughout 2021, 2022 and 2023 (Exh. 13 and 15.) Pak claims 
that she negotiated a reduction of the rent on behalf of the Baird Law Firm, lowering the rent to 
$1800 per month. She claims that she did this to benefit the Baird Law Firm and that it was done 
with Brown's consent. (RT 2/10/25 at p. 8: 19-p, 9:28.) She acknowledged that Norris had no 
legal right to negotiate the lease reduction because he was not on the lease and that Brown was 
not present during these negotiation s. (RT 1 /27 /25, p. 66: 10 to p, 71 :20.) She acknowledges that 
there was no written sublease between Brown and Norris. (RT 2/7/25 RT at p. 10:8-15.) She 
admitted that Norris only made two payments (totaling $15,000) to the Brown firm to cover any 
of the expenses for the office. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 10: 25-12:8; RT 2/14/25 p. 31 :28-32:28, Exh. 11 
and Exh. 1573.) However, she testified generally that whenever the office needed money for 
expenses, either she would make a deposit to the Brown Business account or Norris would pay 
for the expenses. She was only able to point to one such payment in the account records. 
(2/14/25 RT p. 35, ln. 27-and Exhibit 11, pp. 71-72.) 
Nonetheless, the record also supports her claim that Brown expected her to continue their 
operations for some period of time to wind down the cases which had neared settlement or were 
approaching closure; and to allow him to continue to maintain some of his smaller personal 
injury cases. She was authoriz ed then, at a minimum , to continue renting the office space and 
maintainin g their operation to handle these matters. 
With respect to the Baird Brown Client Trust Account, both Brown and Pak had signing 
authority. Throughout 2020 and 2021, Pak was signing checks disbursing funds from the 
account, including payments to doctors, Baird Brown and others. In May of 2020, she signed 
checks issued to Donald Norris Law firm for nearly $60,000. If Brown had been monitoring the 
Client Trust Account records, as he claimed he did, he would have seen these payments. (See 
Exh. I 0.) The last check signed by Baird Brown on the Client Trust Account was signed by him 
in June 2020. Thereafter, only Pak's signature appears on checks drawn on the account, which 
continued until the end of 2022. In the last year for which the court has records (2022), very few 
transactions were conducted on the Client Trust Account and the balance was no more than 
$50,000 (Exh. 12, 14.) Again, had Brown been monitoring the Client Trust Account, he would j
