28 court found this testimony credible and persuasive on the issue of damages caused by plaintiffs ' 
seizure of their office supplies and computers. While Brown may have had the right to restrict 
access to the suite, he excluded the Norris firm in a manner that was extremely disruptive to his 
law practice. Had the Brown firm simply requested Norris to leave within a reasonable time 
frame and to remove his office supplies, equipment and files, these expenses could have been 
avoided. 
Norris did not establish that he was entitled to compensation for his office rental, as Norris 
would always have had to pay at least $3000 for rent even if he had remained at the Brown suite 
of offices. Moreover , he did not present persuasive testimony that he had prepaid for the rent 
for Suite 980 for the months of November , December and January, 2024, although he appears to 
be claiming rent for those months as damages. The court is not persuaded that he even paid rent 
for October 2023, given that the only evidence before the court of rent being paid by Norris was 
$15,000 at an earlier point in time. Pak also did not provide persuasive testimony that she 
personally paid the rent for October 2023. 
With respect to the central issue of the retention of client files, the court finds that cross­
defendants Baird and Ann Brown took possession of files which did not belong to them. The 
court further finds that Ann Brown made the decision to retain the files thereafter based on a 
misconception that all of the files in the office which Brown had occupied for twenty years (and 
which bore his name and which was still occupied by his prior staff members) , belonged to him. 
(RT 3/13/25, pp. 143-158.) Her belief was based on misinformation unintentionally supplied to 
her and to their counsel, the Whites, by Baird Brown, who was experiencing significant memory 
issues and cognitive decline due to Parkinsons disease and a significant Covid-19 illness. She 
did admit, however, that she and her husband (with counsel), decided to withhold files, despite 
being told that at least some of the cases had never belonged to Baird Brown. Those files are 
now in storage, paid for by Mrs. Brown and have not been returned because Mr. Norris would 
not first provide a list of his clients by name so that they could determine true ownership of each 
of the sequestered files. This impasse has gone on for more than a year and half without 
resolution. (Id., at pp. 170-173.) 
After October 21, 2023, the parties entered into a written agreement by which the Brown 
Law firm agreed to provide the Norris law firm with a computer and Norris agreed to provide the 
Brown law firm with a list of all clients Norris claimed to be his exclusive clients. (RT 2/28/24 
at pp. Exh.115-120; and Exh. 1694.) The agreement contained other tem1s about how the parties 
could recover their claimed intellectual material and client files. While Norris signed the 
agreement, he later thought better of it and decided not to provide client names because of 
attorney client privilege concerns. (Id.) Norris admits that he was allowed back in the office on 
October 23, 2025, at which time he was "probably" given the ability to take all of his bank books 
and check books for his business accounts and for his client trust account. He was also allowed 
to identify all files that he wanted copied. However , Norris explained at trial that he was only 
given an hour or so, which was not enough time to go through all the files. (RT 2/28/25 at pp. 
120-125.) He also was very upset by the process, which allowed the Brown law firm to keep a 
company regenerated invoices working off old templates. Ultimately, plaintiffs failed to produce 
credible evidence that Pak or Norris knowingly presented falsified invoices for the computers.
