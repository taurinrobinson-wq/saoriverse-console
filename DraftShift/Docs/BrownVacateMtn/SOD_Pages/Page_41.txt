28 Norris, that Norris had been given permission to use his office and share his staff, and that Pak 
was no longer working for him, except to complete closing out some personal injury cases. He 
conveyed this information to his wife and to his counsel, leading them to take aggressive steps to 
reclaim the office and files, which they quite reasonably believed belonged to the Brown Law

client experiencing serious mental decline. Their conduct under these circumstances cannot be 
construed as malicious , fraudulent or oppressive -merely gravely mistaken .
