28 June 2019 was formally diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. (RT 3/5/25 p. 160:3-13.) In 
December 2019 and January 2020, Brown was frequently absent from the Brown Law offices 
due to extreme back pain which necessitated spinal surgery in December 2019, followed by 
recovery and recuperation well into 2020. (Id., 161 :6 -162: 12.) The Covid-19 lockdown 
required Brown to reduce his exposure to the pandemic by working from his home office, 
starting in March 2020 and continuing until at least March 2023. (Id., 162:24-163:23.) Brown 
suffered a near-fatal infection of Covid-19 in January 2022, causing complete respiratory failure 
which required a ventilator to breathe for him in the Torrance Hospital ICU. (Id., p.164: 10-
166: 16.) In-patient and out-patient treatment s following this serious illness extended into mid-
2022. (Id., 166: 17-26.) 
In addition to these health issues, after a lengthy investigation by the California Bar 
Association , Brown was formally suspended by the California Supreme Court, effective April 1, 
2020, for a period of three months, pursuant to disciplinary proceeding s. (Def. Ex. 15503.) He 
had been facing a one-year suspension. In compliance with Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 
9.20, he submitted a signed declaration under penalty of perjury affirming that he notified all 
clients and urged them to seek alternative counsel (Def. Ex. 15508; RT 1/27/25, Brown Cross, 
48: 1-50:24.) He acknowledged in his own testimony that he signed this declaration , which was 
executed on May 7, 2020. (RT 1/27/25, p. 49:24-51 :6.) 
During the Covid "lockdown ," plaintiff worked at home but communicated regularly, he 
claims, with Pak and staff in his office. (l/23/25 at 25, ln. 9 to 19.) After the lockdown , he 
admitted that he stopped going into the office, except occasiona lly on weekends. (RT 1 /23/25 at 
p. 25:20 -27.) 
Plaintiffs contend that despite these health crises and his suspension, Brown had no intention 
to retire and continued to maintain his practice and go into work on weekend s to review matters 
until June 2023, when he first had suspicions that Michelle Pak, his office manager, was no 
longer working for him and that something was amiss with his cases. (RT 1/22/25 p. 119: 19 -
122: 28.) It was only upon further inquiry after that date that Brown claims he learned for the 
first time that his cases had been transferred to another law firm, the law offices of Donald G. 
Norris, and that his office manager, defendant Pak, was no longer working for him, but for 
Norris. Norris and Pak contend that Brown transferred his mass tort practice to Norris when 
Brown realized that his declining health and the suspension made it impossible to continue to 
practice law and that Brown participated in and consented to the transfer. 
Plaintiff s cognitive decline was on display at trial. While he could understand questions 
and speak clearly and eloquently at times, he appeared to have little memory of past events and 
became easily confused and exhausted on the witness stand. He had little to no recollection of 
what had occurred with his firm or his cases and clients for the entire relevant time period (2019 
to 2023). Indeed, at times he contradicted his attorney and wife's theory of the case by stating 
that he knew Norris would take responsibility for all of his cases. (RT 1/27 /25 am, p. 26: 18-21.) 
The court received testimony from Dr. Matthew Lombard, Brown's treating physician for the
past four or five years, who testified that Brown suffers from Parkinson's disease and some 
memory issues associated with it but has not been diagnosed with dementia. (RT 1/22/25, 84:9-
85:9; 88: 10-11.) Or. Lombard conceded that Brown could suffer from dementia even though he 
has no formal diagnosis, and that if it reached an advanced stage, he could forget meeting
