28 the file cabinets -not enough time to review them all. (RT 3/5/25, p. 87:1-p.89:8.) 
Norris claims that he had his laptop with him during the Starbucks meeting and that his 
laptop was left permanently "on" in his computer bag, such that anyone could gain access to all 
of files on that computer simply by refreshing the screen; one did not have to enter a password. 
He testified that after he left the Wilshire Suite, he realized that he did not have his lap top bag. 
He went back to Starbucks to look for it, but it was not there. He then called the Whites at the 
Wilshire office and asked them whether he had left the bag in the suite. He claims the Whites 
refused to let him enter to look for it. Subsequently , he received some "strange" communications 
from his File and ServeXpress account (required for filing and service in certain cases), which 
indicated that the Brown firm was interfering with his ability to receive court documents. He 
was not able to place a cost on this alleged interference with his files and the court found his 
testimony highly speculative . (RT 3/5/25, pp. 94-104.) The court is not persuaded that the 
plaintiffs or the Whites stole and accessed his laptop; there was insufficient evidence presented 
as to why an error occurred with Norris's File and ServeXpress account. 
Prior to October 21, 2023, staff at the Wilshire office answered the phone: "Law Office 
of Baird Brown and Law Office of Donald Norris." After that date, if someone called asking for 
Norris or his firm, the person answering the phone would state: "Mr. Norris is no longer at this 
number." (RT 3/5/25 pp. 107:17-109:17.)8 Norris did sign a stipulation on October 31, 2023-
he claims under duress --in order to recover client files and computers and related equipment, 
which plaintiffs had taken on October 21, 2023. (RT 3/5/25, p. 110: 10-1 l 6:6, Exhs. 1694 and 
15558.) Norris explained that these files belonged to clients who had never been represented by 
Brown; Norris needed to obtain these files to contact them and to represent them. (id.) Despite 
signing the agreement, plaintiffs never returned the client files to Norris, nor did they return 
Pak's computer, which had a lot of information on it which was not maintained on any of their 
other computers. Due to the actions of the Browns and their counsel, it was impossible for the 
Norris firm to contact their clients, or to access critical information, such as their birth 
certificates and medical files. (Id., at pp.116:7- 117:23.) Norris refused to have the records 
scanned by plaintiff' s counsel because, he explained, it would have meant that attorney client 
communications and client document s were being viewed and retained by someone other than 
their counsel. (Id., at 117:24-119: 1.) 
IV. PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS 
A. Claims Against Taurin Robinson 
There is no evidentiary basis for holding Robinson liable under any theory advanced 
in the complaint. The record is devoid of any proof that Robinson engaged in fraud, 
misconduct or breached any fiduciary duty. At the time of the relevant events, Robinson 
was a law student and junior employee who acted solely under the direction of Brown, 
Norris and Pak. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 88:13-89:4.) He had no decision-making 
authority , no control over client funds or firm assets, and received no financial benefit from the 
alleged conduct. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 93:27-95:1.) Robinson never received any 
8 Notably, the suite of offices still only said "Law Offices of Baird Brown" as of October 21, 
2023. (3/13/25, pp. 119, 21-28.) The Norris Law Firm was never identified on the suite's outer 
doors.
