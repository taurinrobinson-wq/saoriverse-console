28 the wrongful act complained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not 
have averted." Thus, Section 3336 incorporates the concept of mitigation into the affirmative 
burden of proof placed on the plaintiff. 
The evidence established that Norris and the Whites were in contact immediately after Norris 
was barred from the office and his files taken. orris and the Whites entered into an agreement 
by which Norris could have the files returned to him provided he indicated which files he needed 
returned. (Exh. 1694.) Norris decided not to abide by this agreement because he claims he 
concluded that it would violate the attorney-client privilege to provide client names. The court 
finds this contention unavailing from a legal standpoint and also not credible based on the facts 
presented. 
Ordinarily the disclosure of a client's name by the attorney does not violate the attorney 
client privilege. (See People ex rel Herrera v. Stender (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 614, 648-650.) 
Had Norris provided the list as initially agreed, he would not be breaching the privilege with 
those clients. Furthermore, the position he took actually interfered with his representation of 
those clients, preventing him from continuing to represent their interests in a timely and effective 
manner. Because he refused to provide a list of client names to plaintiffs, he had no access to 
these clients' files and could not contact or represent them. Such conduct was unreasonable 
under the circumstances and appears to this court to have been taken to maximize a claim for 
damages rather than to protect his clients' best interests. Had Norris simply provided the names, 
obtained the original files and allowed Brown to keep a copy of the files (with an agreement that 
they would not be reviewed), any damage to the clients would have been prevented, as we�l as 
any financial loss to the Norris firm. Under the circumstances, the court finds that this conduct 
on the part of the Norris firm is a clear example of failure to mitigate damages. It is well­
established that a "plaintiff cannot be compensated for damages that were not incurred or could 
have been mitigated by reasonable effort or expenditures." (Powerhouse Motorsports GrO'/i'P, 
Inc. v. Yamaha Motor Corp., USA (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 884, citing Lu v. Grewal (2005) 130 
Cal.App.4th 841, 849-850.) Further, as indicated elsewhere in the statement of decision, it was 
reasonable for the Brown defendants to initially take the files and to insist that they be able to 
retain a copy, not to review, but to ensure they were not later accused of destroying documents or 
failing to return them, as happens unfortunately, with great frequency in disputes over retention 
of files. 
In sum, the only credible evidence of damages presented by the Norris cross-complainants 
for their claim of conversion relates to the cost of supplies, computers, advertising and staff time 
to reconstruct files, or a total of $60,670.75. 
2.Second Cause of Action (Violation of Penal Code§ 502, CACI 1812, 1814)
The Norris cross-complainants claim that cross-defendants intentionally and knowingly 
accessed and copied confidential digital files belonging to the Norris Law Firm without consent, 
in violation of Penal Code section 502. 
The court finds that cross-complainants have established that cross-defendants intentionally 
accessed and copied confidential digital files belonging to the orris Law Firm without consent. 
Indeed, Jonathan White admitted that all computers were forensically imaged using Pixley 
Foren ics at the Browns' direction, without any investigation into whether those computer� were
