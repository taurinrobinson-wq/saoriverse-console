28 following a deposit into the account from the client trust account by Pak. (Id .. ) Thus, by the end 
of May 2019, Pak had taken $243,500 out of the Client Trust Account to purchase leads for 
Norris. 
Pak explained these expenditures as follows: She claims that as of May 14, she had an 
earnings credit of $100,000 in the Client Trust Account from February 2019 because in February 
BrownLaw had issued $215,000 to Brown and $115,000 to Pak's company USCV, shorting her 
by $100,000. She also presented evidence that she had a credit of $230,000 with BrownLaw 
because she had assumed a loan in that amount owed by a former client to Baird Brown. That 
evidence was not refuted and was corroborated by the client, Carolina Navarro. (3/7/2 Tr. 
136:20-26.) Moreover , Pak presented evidence that the court found credible that Brown was 
reviewing all of these transactions and raised no objections to them. As stated elsewhere in this 
opinion, Brown was competent in 2019 and handling his business affairs. Moreover, he knew 
the leads were not being purchased for the Brown firm because he was stepping back from the 
firm, transferring his clients to Norris and not intending to practice law in the future. He could 
not have intended Pak to be purchasing hundreds of leads for his own firm, since he had no 
lawyer (other than Norris) associating in to handle these cases. 
Nonetheless, Pak was responsible for managing the payments and the books and her 
accounting practices likely were confusing to Brown. Her testimony that she had an earned 
income credit of $100,000 as of May 2019 was demonstrated to be false by the records submitted 
and the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Holstrom. Indeed, by May 14, 2019, Pak had already 
transferred $40,000 (two checks of $20,000) to herself from the business account, reducing any 
credit to $60,000. The evidence presented also showed that by October 14, 2019, she had 
transferred another $75,000 to her company , without comparable payouts to Brown. (Ex.h. 7.) 
Thus, the $100,000 credit was ephemeral. At best, plaintiffs admit Pak had a credit of $20,000 
by the end of 2019. (See Brief, at p. 7, Ins. 11-15.) 
Accordingly, the court finds that Pak has presented adequate evidence that she had 
$230,000 in a credit, justifying her transfer of $230,000 of the $243,500 from the client trust 
account in May 2019 to purchase leads. She has not adequately explained the additional $13,50 
she transferred in May. 
Turning to the June 3, 2019 wire transfer of $100,000 from the business account to 
purchase leads from SMG, plaintiffs failed to establish that this expenditure was improper. 
Immediately before this wire transfer out, Pak wired $200,000 of her own money into the 
account. (Tr Ex.h. 7, p. 48.) Even if her testimony about this transfer was confusing at trial, tha 
testimony did not make this transaction a breach of her fiduciary duty to Brown. The parties had 
an understanding, the court finds, that the business account could be used by Pak to conduct 
these types of transactions, even if not for the immediate benefit of Brown or the BrownLaw 
firm. Thus, the $100,000 spent on June 3 is adequate ly accounted for by Pak and does not 
constitute a breach of her fiduciary duty to plaintiffs. But the court agrees with Plaintiffs that 
Pak then transferred $100,000 out of the account for her own purposes, leaving no excess to 
cover the other transactions discussed below. 
With respect to the August 19, 2019 transfer of $40,000 to OPL, Pak has not presented 
credible evidence that she had a credit or other money available to her in the Client Trust 
Account, which would cover this payment to OPL. Therefore, plaintiffs have established that
