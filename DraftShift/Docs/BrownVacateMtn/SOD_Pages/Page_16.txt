28 The only group of cases for which there was a written agreement between the parties 
related to litigation over testosterone cream, referred to as the "Androgel cases." (RT 3/5/25, pp. 
13:28 -14:24.) Norris testified that he received an email "out of the blue" drafted by Brown,
which provided that Norris would complete the cases and receive 20% of the attorney fees in
exchange. (RT 2/28/25, pp. 13-20.) Through Norris's testimony and Exhibits 1, 2, 3 1446, and 
1686 to 1688, it is clear that Brown was well aware that Pak was acting as Norris's manager, as 
Brown exchanged multiple emails with her about the split of the Androgel fees in the November 
2020 period, in which Pak was negotiating on behalf of Norris, not Brown. (RT 2/28/25 at pp. 
25-36 and Exh. 1446.) Norris testified that Brown was fully paid his 80% of the Androgel fees. 
(RT 3/5/25, p 15.) Brown never asked for a fee split on any of the other cases that were 
transferred to Norris. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 67-68.) 
Norris had no good explanation why there was no written agreement between himself and 
Brown for the transfer of the other mass tort cases. (RT 2/28/25, pp. 37-40.) Norris testified 
simply that they had an oral agreement that Norris wo uld be taking over these other cases, 
reached initially in July 2019, and then affirmed by their conduct and subsequent conversations 
over the next many months. (Id.) Defendant s' counsel established that even though Brown had 
Norris's emailand phone number, Brown never wrote to him (or spoke with him) to demand 
payment on any case or to express disagreement with Norris' involvement in these cases until 
years later in 2023. (RT 3/5/35 pp. 14-15.) 
With respect to the Roh case, Norris testified that the case had been filed by Brown on 
behalf of an injured truck driver. Norris believed that it could be a high value case due to the 
nature of the plaintiff's injuries and need for significant future medical care. When he became 
aware of the case, very little had been done and no discovery had been taken. He was able to go 
into the Brown office's SugarSync system and see the work that had been done, as well as what 
had not been done. Norris put "a lot of hours" into the case, including conducting all discovery 
and handling sett lement negotiations. While the PanishShea & Boyle case had done some work 
on the case, Norris concluded that their work on the case had terminated upon an early mediation 
and that their lien had no validity. The Panish firm ultimately dropped their claim for payment. 
(RT 3/5/25, pp. 68-73, and Exh. 416.) Norris confirmed that the case ultimately settled for $2.5 
million, from whichthe Norris law firm took attorney fees of $632,000. While they were entitled 
to more, Norris personally only received approximately $60,000 from the Roh settlement , as 
over $500,000 was used to buy new leads, pay off loans from Pak, and pay office expenses . (Id. 
at pp. 74-77, and Exh. 1656.) He conceded that $261,000 of the attorney fees was transferred to 
Pak but cannot reconstruct precisely what that payment was for, as all of his notes were taken by 
the Whites and plaintiffs on October 21, 2023. (Id., at 78-79.) 
Norris concedes his firm also received a large settlement for the "Roundup" mass tort 
cases, for which Pak was paid $874,000. He testified that this constituted repayment to Pak for 
the money she had paid to purchase leads of clients in the Roundup cases. (Id., at 79-80.) 
At Pak'sdirection , sometime in July 2019, Norris drafted a compensation agreement to 
govern her work with his firm. Although he drafted it at Pak'sdirection, Pak told him that 
Brown had reviewed it and told her it "looked good." (RT 3/5/25, p.16:20 -17:9.) Brown 
explained he never signed the agreemen t because he was not sure it was "kosher" under the 
ethics rules and he wanted to see how their business together progressed. (3/5/25, pp. 17: 12 -
