28 Accordingly , the court finds in favor 
of Andrew White, Jonathan White, Baird Brown and 
Ann Brown on Pak's claims for assault and battery. 
As for her remaining causes of action --1) Breach of Contract, 2) Money Had and Received, 
3) Open Book Account, 4) Account Stated, 5) Conversion, 6) Unauthorized Computer Access 
(violation of Penal Code §502), and 7) Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. --Pak 
failed to establish all of the elements for any of these causes of action, entitling cross-defendants 
to judgment on these claims. 
E. Counter-Claims of Donald Norris and Donald Norris, a Law Corporation 
As stated previously , in contrast to Pak, the court found Norris's testimony to be credible on 
most points, even if evasive or overly cautious at times. The court did not find him to be 
exaggerating or downplaying negative facts. He satisfied the court that he was not aware of any 
malfeasance of Pak towards Brown, that he reasonably trusted her representations about Brown' 
involvement and agreement with the transfer of clients, and that she was conducting the actual 
communicating with clients with Brown's consent and oversight. Perhaps he should have 
scrutinized every step of the process more carefully and obtained Brown's written consent to 
each step, but the court knows of no legal authority requiring that he do so. He justifiably relied 
on representations made to him by Brown and by Brown's trusted office manager to accept that 
these cases were being transferred to him to work up and complete, because Brown was 
withdrawing from them as counsel because of his intent to retire. 
1. First Cause of Action -Conversion (Civ. Code§ 3336, CACI 2100) 
The Norris cross-complainants contend that the cross-defendants unlawfully converted the 
personal property of the Norris firm and its clients by seizing and retaining client files, 
computers, locked file cabinets, and critical law firm infrastructure, without notice, consent, or 
legal process. This included physical hardware , digital data, and confidential documents 
belonging solely to the Norris Law Firm. They contend they suffered substantial and 
documentable damages as a direct result of the unauthorized office takeover on October 21, 202 
and their inability to gain access to their files. Specifically , they claim that they lost the costs o 
leads they had paid for in the amount of $605,074.8, as well as $120,011.38 in documented 
expenses they were required to incur to reestablish their practice after being forcibly removed 
from their prior office. (Ex. 15562; RT 3/7/25, Norris Direct, 160:3-166:15) . 
Civil Code section 3336 states that "[t]he detriment caused by the wrongful conversion of 
personal property is presumed to be: ¶First-The value of the property at the time of the 
conversion , with the interest from that time, or, an amount sufficient to indemnify the party 
injured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of the wrongful act 
complained of and which a proper degree of prudence on his part would not have averted; and 
[1] Second-A fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the 
property. " 
Cross-complainant s established that on October 21, 2023, cross-defendants entered Suite 980 
at 3055 Wilshire Blvd. There was nothing unlawful about this entry. At the time, Brown was th 
lawful tenant and leaseholder , and he maintained employee s, including Pak, working on his 
remaining cases. The court agrees that Norris also had a right to be on the premises as a co-
