The court asked for further briefing from Pak's counsel to explain the source of these 
funds and to respond to the objection s. The court finds Pak's explanation unhelpful in many 
respects or not squared with the evidence presented. The court discusses each of these 
transactions further below. 
It is undisputed that Pak purchased leads from several firms at a total cost of $653,500 in 
2019 for use by the Norris firm. The evidence also showed that some of these funds originated 
in the Brown Client Trust Account, were transferred by Pak to the Brown Business Account 
(account ending 3119) and were then wired by Pak to third parties to purchase several tranches 
of client leads. The court finds that Pak had full authority and access to both of those accounts 
pursuant to her agreement with Brown. The court also finds that Brown was writing checks from 
the same two accounts in 2019 and so would have been aware of these transactions but made no 
objection. The court finds that Brown knew that Pak was purchasing leads (because of the name 
of the payee) but did not know that she was purchasing leads for the Norris firm as opposed to 
the Baird firm. Plaintiffs met their burden at trial of establishlng that some of these funds either 
originated in the Baird Brown Client Trust Account or the business account, which would 
constitute a breach of fiduciary duty if those funds were used for anything other than the benefit 
of the firm and/or Brown. Thus, the burden shifted to Pak to establish that these funds, in fact, 
belonged to her to use as she elected. The court finds that Pak has not met that burden with 
respect to all of these transactions. Moreover, Pak' s explanation for the source of these funds 
was not credible in some respects. 
In her response to plaintiffs' objections filed on November 3, 2025, Pak claims that the 
disputed purchases of $635,500 in leads for the Norris firm "were funded by Ms. Pak through a 
combinatio n of direct contributions and assumed obligations: 
• $335,000 wired into BrownLaw' s account from Ms. Pak's personal funds (Ex. B, 
Trial Tr. 2/14/25 at 50: 15-28, 52:4-6) 
• $230,000 from a loan originally made to Mr. Brown by Carolina Navarro, which 
Ms. Pak assumed (Ex. B, Trial Tr. 2/14/25 at 51 :5-58:10; Ex. C. 3/7/25 at 
123:6-13, 124:1-12) 
• $100,000 retained earnings credit established on February 26, 2019, when 
BrownLaw issued $215,000 to Mr. Brown and $115,000 to Ms. Pak's company, 
USCV (Ex. B, Trial Tr. 2/14/25 at 53:1-2; TrEx 7, p. 13) 
(Response of Defendan t/Cross-complainant Pak to Plajntiffs' Objections to Court 
Proposed Statement of Decision, p. 3.) As explained further below, these assertions do not 
establish that all of these lead purchases were funded by Pak's own money or money she was 
owed under her profit-sharing agreement with Brown. 
The first transaction that the Browns challenge as suspect was a $195,000 payment from 
the Brown Business Account (3119) dated May 14, 2019 to purchase leads from a company 
referred to as "B Partners." The bank records show that this same amount was transferred by 
Pak to account 3119 a day before from the BrownLaw client trust account. (Exh. 8, p. 27.) Th 
same is true for the next purchase of leads made on May 31, 2019 in the amount of$48,500. 
(Exh. 7, p. 38.) The evidence shows this money was paid out of the business account by Pak,
