28 settlement funds or other compens ation despite his salary. (RT 1/28/25, Robinson, direct, 93:27-
95: l.) Brown testified that only he and Pak had access to the firm's bank accounts. (RT 
1/28/25, Brown, cross, 18:9-19:2.) 
When initially asked what Robinson did wrong, Brown responded that Robinson 
had facilitated transfers of money from the Brown Law bank accounts. (RT 1/28/25, Brown, 
cross, 27:5-10.) However, when confronted with his earlier testimony that only he and Pak 
had account access, Brown conceded , "[t]hat's a fair point. Maybe he didn't." (RT 1/28/25, 
Brown, cross, 27: 11-28:4.) When asked whether Robinson did anything else wrong, Brown 
admitted , "[n]othing else comes to mind." (RT 1/28/25, Brown, cross, 28:5-7.) 
B. Claims Against Donald G. Norris and Donald G. Norris, A Law Corporation 
The court prefaces its findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the claims 
brought against Norris and his law corporation with the critical finding that Brown practiced 
alone prior to his suspension and thereafter. Brown never had a partner, associate , or "of 
counsel" attorney associated with his firm to assist him with the practice of law. (RT 1/23/25 at 
p. 34:2-14.) He admitted that when he was sick with Covid for an extended period in 2022, there 
was no attorney handling any of his cases to his knowledge and he was not bringing in any new 
cases. His wife confirmed this. When asked how he was paying his staff, he stated that he did 
not recall. (Id., at p. 34: 15-36: 16.) He did have various paralegals working for him, all non­
attomeys, and an office manager, defendant Michelle Pak, who was actively engaged in helping 
him attract clients and run his law practice. Neither Pak nor the various legal assistants could 
legally practice law or handle legal matters without Brown 's active participation and supervision. 
Thus, for the three months that he was suspended, no work could take place on any of these cases 
without some lawyer other than Brown being responsible for the work. According to Brown, he 
did not arrange to hire an attorney or associate in an attorney to handle the work during his 
suspension; he simply sent notices to clients to let them know there were two attorneys they 
could call if they had a concern: Norris and another contract attorney named Davis. 
In addition, Brown and his counsel provided no explanation as to what lawyer was handling 
his practice when he had back surgery and a long recovery at the end of 2019 and early 2020; 
who handled it during his suspension in 2020 and who handled it when he was on a ventilator, 
hospitalized or in rehab through much of 2022. Either Brown agreed to have Norris take over 
the practice, as Norris testified, or Brown was planning to have non-lawyers run his practice, 
which would be illegal. The court finds it more likely than not that Brown accepted that he 
needed to transfer his cases to another attorney, here Norris, due to his declining health. Further, 
the court finds it more likely than not that due to his many health issues and cognitive decline, 
when he looked back into the affairs of his office in 2023 (after nearly three years of inaction on 
his part), he had forgotten that he had agreed to the transfer. The court believes that in 2023 and 
thereafter he was truly bewildered about what had transpired. Having not shared any of this 
information with his wife, she justifiabl y was concerned that Pak and Norris had colluded to 
push her husband out. 
Indeed, Brown admitted that after his suspension concluded at the end of June 2020, 
whatever work he did on his cases thereafter was "fairly minor." (RT 1/23/25 p. 46:24-28.) He 
could not recall at the time of trial any work he had done on any case, or whether he had even 
gone to court on a case. (Id., at p. 47:1-28.) Notably, no evidence was presented by plaintiffs'
