28 2020 she 
knew that Brown was going to be suspended as they had already discussed it, along 
with his intention to retire, contradicting her earlier testimony that she did not know about his 
suspension until April 2020. (RT 2/5/25 at 24:9-p. 28: 13 and Exh. 167l) She maintains that 
she was still acting as Brown's office manager when she sent the substitution documents to Roh 
and explained to him that the case was being transferred to Norris. (Id., at 36, Ins. 16-21.) She 
also admitted at trial that she knew the Roh case was a "multimillion " dollar case. (Id., at 40, 18-
21.) She claims she told Roh that the case was being transferred to Norris because of Brown's 
suspension and because he intended to retire. (Id., at 31, Ins. 20-26.) She admitted that at the 
time she knew that Brown had associated in Brian Panish as co-counsel only a month earlier but 
explains that it was her understanding that the Panish firm was only going to help with 
settlement, not actual litigation . (Id., at 29, In. 4-p. 30, In. 16; and Exh. 1527.) Realizing her 
numerou s inconsistencies, she then testified that Brown discussed with her that he was going to 
be suspended before March 2020. (Id., at p. 34, ln. 4-25.) She was impeached with her 
deposition testimony where she stated that he did not tell her about the suspension until the end 
of March and she did not tell Norris about it until after they received the suspension letter. 
(Depo. Transcript, p. 117:10-18 ; pp.234:5-235:10.) 
Pak was questioned about the timing of the process for obtaining substitution of attorney 
forms from Brown's clients. With respect to the Roh case, she admitted that substitution of 
attorney form had been sent to the Roh family on or about February 21, 2020, to replace Brown 
with the Norris law firm, but was not signed by Baird Brown until April 13, 2020. (RT 1/27/25, 
p. 18:22-p. 21 :25, and Exh. 1653 and 1655.)3 She denied that Brown had taken significant 
deposition s in the case, testifying instead that Norris conducted the bulk of the work in the case, 
ultimately settling it for $2.5 million. (Id., at 26:9-28:21.) She also testified Brown took less 
than the 40% provided for in the retainer agreement and concedes that her daughter was repaid 
out of the settlement proceeds for money her daughter had allegedly lent to the plaintiff to cover 
his living expenses. (Id., at p.28:26 -33:7.) For reasons that were never adequately explained, 
she was paid $300,000 out of the Roh settlement proceeds, while the attorney on the case -
Donald Norris- received only $70,000. (Id., at p. 44:17-28; RT 2/5/25 at p. 43:15-19.) No 
money was set aside from the Roh settlement to satisfy a lien from Brown and he asserted no 
lien, to Pak's knowledge. (2/5/25 at p. 44, In. 8-13.) 
Pak testified that under her contractual agreement with Brown, even if the contract was 
terminated she was still required to "see to the books" and the accounting until all of the cases 
were finished and all of the medical liens satisfied. (RT 1/27/25, p. 67:4-19.) She claims she 
performed these services diligently after April 2020, trying to finish up the various cases in 
Brown's case load. (RT 2/14/25, p. 126:22-127:6.) Pak claimed that she paid all of the 
operating expenses out of the Baird Brown Business Account. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 72:6 -15.) Pak 
3 Although the court agreed with Brown's counsel that the substitution appeared to have been 
doctored to change the Norris law firm name and address, which is not proper, Brown appears to 
have signed the substitution on April 13, 2020, indicating that he knew the case was being 
transferred to Norris. Roh also appears to have agreed to the substitution. The court did not find 
this altered document to be evidence that Norris deceived Brown into transferring the case. 
(Exh. 1653 and 1654, 1655.) There was no persuasive evidence that Norris knew anything abou 
the manipulation of the address line. (RT 2/28/25 at p. 45-47.) The court finds it more likely 
than not that Pak oversaw manipulation of the document to ensure that the substitution was 
accurate for purposes of the court, without either Norris or Brown's knowledge.
