28 to Brown by negotiating a balloon payment, using the office suite for her new business with
Norris and not paying her share of the balloon payment. There was no evidence that Norns 
participated in this breach or was even aware of it. 
With respect to the claim that Norris violated Business & Professions Code Section 
17200 by using Brown's likeness on Norris's website, the court finds that the evidence is unclear 
whether Brown's photo and bio was visible to the public and, if so, for how long. The court 
finds credible Norris's testimony that he did not direct that Brown's image be used. The only 
evidence of Brown's image being visible to the public shows what appears to be a website under 
construction. Assuming, arguendo, that it was visible to people accessing Norris's website for 
some uncertain period of time, the court finds that no damage has been established , nor can be 
presumed. Under the circumstances, plaintiffs have failed to prove that the website photo and bio 
constitutes an unfair business practice. 
Finally, the court does find that it was deceptive advertising to describe Norris as an 
associate of the law firm or his firm as a division of the Brown law firm in letters sent to the 
clients. The description might have misled clients to believe there was a long-standing 
relationship between the two firms or attorneys, that Norris was in fact covered by Brown's 
malpractice insurance , or that the two firms were one and the same. These letters should have 
been drafted in a way that did not create a false impression of a prior or existing relationship 
between the two firms. But these communications, while deceptive , did not cause any damage 
to the Brown law firm or deprive it of any money which could be restored, given that the court 
finds that Brown approved the transfer of all of these cases to Norris. Further, the court finds 
that Brown was actively running hi s office in 2019 and early 2020 and had full access to these 
letters that were being sent to clients. Thus, he would have approved these mailings, even if he 
no longer remembers that he did so. Plaintiffs have failed to establish any basis for recovery 
under Section 17200. 
C. Claims Solely Against Pak -Breach of Fiduciary Duty 
Judge Recana determined that Pak owed a fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs from 2015 to at least 
April 1, 2020. (Order, 11/20/2024, pp. 6-7; emphasis added.) Brown confirmed that she held a 
trusted position in his firm from at least 2015 through the spring of 2023. (1/23/25 at p. 22, ln 11 
to 25, In. 8.) The court finds that Pak continued to owe Brown a fiduciary duty through October 
21, 2023, at least with respect to the handling of the cases and work she continued to manage for 
him during that period. Pak did not persuade the court that all such work was completed by that 
time. As such, he continued to require her undivided care and loyalty for the handling of those 
cases and management of his finances relating to those cases. Judge Recana set forth those 
duties: 
"Every employee owes his or her employer duties of undivided care and loyalty." 
(Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs. (l 996) 46 Cal.App.4th 55, 74.) "California law does 
not authorize an employee to transfer his loyalty to a competitor. During the term 
of employment, an employer is entitled to its employees' 'undivided loyalty."' 
(Fowler v. Varian Assocs., (1987), 196 Cal.App.3d 34, 41 [finding a former 
marketing manager owed a fiduciary duty to his former employer, which the manager 
breached when he attempted to compete directly with his former employer) .) 
"During the term of employment , an employer is entitled to its employees'
