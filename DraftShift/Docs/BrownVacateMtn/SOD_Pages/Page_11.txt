28 have known that no payments were being received from clients either byway of settlement or 
other means. All parties acknowledge that Brown had access to the Client Trust account at all 
times and could have seen all the checks she wrote. (2/7/25 RT at p. 73:15-25.) 
Pak was questioned about payments made from the Baird Brown checking account ending 
3119. She confirmed that the following payments were made to purchase leads for mass tort 
cases: $195,000 was paid to Broughton Partners on May 14, 2019, $48,500 to Sequoia Media 
Group on May 31, 2019, another $100,000 to Sequoia and $40,000 to On Point Legal on August 
19, 2019, $135,000 on October 22, 2019 to Broughton Partners, and$ I 35,000 on October 23, 
also to Broughton. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 18: 9-20:21, and Exh. 7.) She claimed that all of these 
payments were made with her money, even though the payments were made from the Baird 
Brown business account. (Id.) She admitted that she was making these payments to purchase 
leads for the Norris law firm, starting as early as May 24, 2019. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 24:27-27:21.) 
She then altered her testimony and stated that she did not start working for Norris until the end o 
June or early July 2019. (Id., at p. 28, In. 19-25.) (As stated above, this testimony at trial 
contradicted her deposition testimony.) She claims that Brown approved this method of paying 
for leads for Norris: putting the money into the Brown business account so it could be written off 
as a business expenses for the Brown firm, but then used by the Norris firm. (2/14/25 pp. 38-
41.) As trial went on, Pak's testimony changed yet again about who she purchased the leads for, 
undermining her credibility further. (RT 2/14/25 RT at pp. 45-49.) 
Ultimately, Pak claims she invested $4 million of her own money between April 1, 2020 and 
October 2023 purchasing leads for Norris's law firm. (2/10/25 RT at p. 11, 4 to 8.) She testified 
that it was her intent to become an investor in his firm and that she expected to be paid back 
"dollar for dollar" for the money she had invested in the firm through the purchase of leads. (RT 
2/14/25 at pp. 122-123.) 
Of the $635,000 which came from Brown's business account to purchase leads, she 
explained $100,000 was in her "account" based on her taking less than her full draw in February 
2019; $335,000 she wired in to the account and $230,000 was a note she took over from Brown. 
(RT 2/14/25 at p. 50:18-58:10.) As Pak explained, Brown had borrowed $230,000 from Ms. 
Navarro, his former client and sometime legal assistant; by assuming his debt, she was able to 
take $230,000 out of his business account to purchase leads. Ms. Navarro confirmed that Pak 
took over this loan. 
Pak testified that at the end of May or early June 2019, she had a conversation with Brown 
about transferring his case load to a new attorney. Brown told her to look for an attorney to tak 
over the mass tort cases. At the time of this conversation, she did not yet know Norris. She 
claims she told a friend that she was looking for an attorney and the attorney connected her with 
Norris, pointing out that both Norris and Brown had gone to Stanford. She did not know Norris 
before that introduction was made. Pak testified that she told Brown she would be meeting wit 
Norris and he approved. (2.7.25 p. 87:21-91:26.) 
She then met with Norris sometime in June, discussed the opportunity with him, and Norris 
agreed to meet with Brown. (RT 2/7/25, p. 93:8-28.) She set up a meeting with Norris and 
Brown on July 11, 2019; it was the first opportunity for the two attorneys to meet. Nonetheless, 
Pak admitted at trial that she had already paid for and obtained leads supposedly for Norris and 
she and Norris were drawing up sample letters of introduction to Brown's clients, which could b
