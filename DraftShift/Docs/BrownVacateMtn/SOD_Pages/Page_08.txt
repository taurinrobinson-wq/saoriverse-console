28 shook, but he seemed to be mentally alert and able to run his firm, just as he had in the past. (RT 
2/14/25, p. 101-102.) 
Around this same time, May or June of 2019, Pak claims she told Brown that in light of 
his decision to retire, her contractual relationship with him was terminated. Later in her 
testimony , she placed this conversation as early as April 2019, explaining that it was 
immediatel y after the MRI which diagnosed Brown with Parkinson 's. Even later in her 
testimony, she stated that June 2020 was the first time that she told him that their contract was 
voided. (RT 2/14/25 RT at p. 21 :6 -22:3.) With leading, she then corrected herself again and 
said the first time she told Brown their agreement was voided was June 2019. (Id., at p. 22:13-
25.) Then she doubled down and stated that she told him their contract was voided in June 2020. 
Despite all this prevaricating, she claims that Brown and she discussed at some uncertain time 
that she could continue to work in the office, overseeing the settlement of their cases, handling 
the medical liens, and she was told to finish the work, even that which an attorney should do. 
She tried to communicate with Brown in the ensuing months about some of the cases as they 
wound up, but she asserts he expressed little interest in them, particularly the low value cases. 
(Id., at p. 23:3 top. 27:23.) 
Pak claims that when Brown told her that he wanted to retire in 2019, he explained that 
he wanted to keep only a few of the individual personal injury cases. He informed her he did not 
want to keep the mass tort cases because they took two to six years to complete. (RT 2/7/25, p. 
80: 10-28.) He also wanted to retain some cases which had "already settled," like the Androgel 
case. (Id.) With respect to the Androgel case, he told Pak because it was nearly completely 
settled, he wanted Norris to take it over, for an 80/20 fee split in Brown's favor. (Id., at p. 81: 13-
25.) 
Pak testified that although she was aware that Brown was the subject of a state bar 
investigation in 2019 (and had hired an attorney to represent him in that matter), she was 
shocked to find out in March of 2020 that the bar was going to suspend him. He had not told her 
that he might be suspended. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 78:3 -p. 80:9.) 
She gave conflicting testimony about when she first met Norris and when they began to 
work together. In her deposition , she claimed that she first started working for Norris after 
Brown's suspension became effective on April 1, 2020. (RT 1/27/25 p.m., p. 42:8 -44:20.) Yet 
she also admitted that she signed a document on July 30,2019, nearly a year earlier, which she 
claims Norris drafted, which would have had her receive 90% ofNorris's mass-tort practice. (Id., 
at p. 39: 1 to p. 42: 7, and Exh. 1512.) She further claimed that it was Brown who suggested she 
draw up the agreement reflected in Exh. 1512 and 1670, when she and Brown met in Brown's 
office in June 2019 to discuss his Parkinson's diagnosis. In this conversation, Pak claims he told 
her that she should enter into a profit-sharing arrangement with Norris and even encouraged her 
to ask for 90% of the profits. (Id., at p. 50, In. 16-p. 55, In. 20.) She conceded that the 90% spli 
of profits she was discussing with Norris was far more lucrative than the 50% share she received 
from the Brown firm. (RT 2/14/25 TR, p. 122:20-125:5.) 
Although she testified on one day that she first started working with Norris after April 1, 
2020, she testified elsewhere that in February 2020, she contacted one of Baird's clients, Hyung 
Roh, and told him that his case was going to be transferred to Don Norris and sent him a 
Substitution of Attorney form which had been prepared by Brown. She claims that in February
