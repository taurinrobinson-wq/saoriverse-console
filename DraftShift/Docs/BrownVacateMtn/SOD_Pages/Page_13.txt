28 Brown Law Firm. There 
was no evidence presented that Norris instructed anyone to send these 
letters or that he took part in drafting them. (RT 2/7/25 at p. 30:9-34: 16 and Exh.154.) Pak_also 
confirmed that in late 2019 through early 2020, paralegals in the Brown Law Fmn were calling 
clients, encouraging them to switch to the Norris Law Firm. (Id., at 35:21-37: I 0.) Sheadmitted 
that the script used by their legal assistants was deceptive, as it described Donald Noms as an 
"associate branch" of the Brown Law Firm, which he was not. (Id.) Other deceptive 
communications were sent to clients in the December 2019 period, describing Norris as a 
"litigation attorney" in the Brown firm. (Id., at p 39: 17-46:9 and Exhs. 452, 1554, and 1558.) 
The court finds it more probable than not that Pak was directing that these communications be 
sent by legal assistants in the firm. There was no evidence that Norris was aware of these 
communications. 
Pak testified that she knew that an entire box of more than l 00 notice letters to clients, 
required to be sent by the State Bar, had not been sent to clients. She claims Brown told her not 
to send them and so they remained, sitting in a box, until October 2023 when Brown and his 
attorneys came to the office and requested that she leave. (RT 2/7/25, p. 50:7 -53:8.) 
Ultimately, the court did not place much weight on this box of unsent letters. As stated 
elsewhere, the court does not believe Pak's testimony, given her general lack of credibility, Mr. 
Brown does not have sufficient memory to know what occurred with this box, and the court 
could not see any particular gain to anyone that it was not sent. 
Pak was present on October 21, 2023 when Brown, his wife, and his attorneys came to the 
office with several other people. She was handed a termination letter, which was also read to her 
by Brown's attorneys. (RT 2/5/25 p. 55:17 -57:3.) During this incident, she repeatedly asserted 
to Brown's attorneys that all of the office equipment, furniture and computers were her personal 
property or purchased with her money. (Id.) 
Of the seven computers which she claimed to have purchased, only three have been 
returned to her. (Id., at p. 58. Lns. 6-7.) When asked to provide invoices to prove that she had 
purchased the four other computers and their costs, she presented invoices she obtained from the 
vendor. Brown's counsel established that some of the invoices appear to be generated from 
earlier invoices. (RT2/7/25 atp. 13:8 -17:16.) 
Testimony of Bruce Pixley 
Although plaintiffs presented the evidence of computer expert Bruce Pixley, who questioned 
the authenticit y and history of an email sent on April 24, 2020 which purportedly showed Brown 
receiving email notification of some of the letters going out to clients, the court found this 
testimony largely irrelevant given the other evidence that Brown was aware of and had approved 
the plan to transfer the mass tort clients to Norris. The court also found largely irrelevant the 
extensive testimony presented by Pixley about whether information about Brown and his photo 
had been briefly visible on Norris's website. As explained above, the court finds that Pak was 
primarily responsible for overseeing and managing the transfer of cases; the court finds she also 
hired the people who put together the website. Given that Brown had approved the transfer, as 
the court finds, the court finds it hardly surprising that some of the advertising materials used 
continued to make mention of Brown. The court did not find the use of Brown's image and 
information for some period of time on the website to be deceptive or injurious to Brown in any 
way. Both Brown and Norris would have benefited if clients thought they were associated, as it
