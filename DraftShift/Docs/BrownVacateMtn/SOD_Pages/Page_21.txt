28 confirms that Norris assumed representation of Brown's former clients with no objection raised. 
(Def. Exs. 15555, 1692; Pl. Exs. 1653-1655.) Again, either Brown knew and consented to these 
substitutions or he was not monitoring his federal practice for over three years. The court finds 
it is more likelythan not that he consented to these substitutions; not that he engaged in 
deliberate malpractice or unethical conduct. 
Finally, the email exchange between Brown and Pak in June 2023, the questions posed by 
Brown to Granillo in June 2023, and the series of text messages spanning March 26, 2020 to 
June 2023 (Exh. 1573) strongly support the court's conclusion that Brown was not doing 
anything to actively supervise and manage his cases after he was first suspended on April 1, 
2020, but rather understood that the law practice was being run by Norris. (RT 3/4/25, pp. 49-
50.) That Brown had no idea what the status of his various cases was in June 2023 means he had 
not been supervising them or moving them forward. Had he attempted to take any action on 
behalf of any of his cases in the period between April 1, 2020 and June 2023, he would have 
realized that he had been substituted out in early 2020 and that another attorney, Donald Norris, 
had been handling many of these matters. 
J. Claim for Theft and Conversion Against Norris and Norris Law Corporation -(Cal. 
Penal Code§ 496(c)) 
Conversion requires that Plaintiffs prove ownership or a right to possess specific 
property, that Defendant s substantially interfered with that property through unauthorized 
conduct, and that Plaintiffs were harmed as a result. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General 
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97.) 
Plaintiffs did not establish that the Norris defendant s took or retained plaintiffs' property. 
Plaintiffs failed to prove that Norris wrongfully obtained any clients or retained funds received in 
settlement for those clients which rightfully belonged to plaintiffs. The court finds that Brown 
voluntarily transferred the contested cases to Norris, commencing in 2019, because of his desire 
to wind down his practice and withdraw from the active practice of law given his significant 
health issues, and later, his suspension by the state bar. While Brown's cognitive function was 
profoundly impaired at trial (and was significantly impaired as early as January 2022 when he 
nearly died from Covid), all witnesses agreed that Brown was functioning well enough in 2019 
and 2020 to understand that he was voluntarily transferring his cases to Norris, to cooperate in 
that process, and to negotiate many aspects of it. Anyone dealing with him during that process, 
including but not limited to Pak and Norris, would reasonably have believed that he had full 
capacity to make the decision to wind down his practice and transfer his cases. The court 
concludes that any deceptive practices which were instituted -and there were misstatements 
made to clients to grease the wheels of moving clients to a new law firm -were conceived and 
executed by Pak. The court finds that Norris had no knowledge of the communication s being 
sent to clients and did not conspire or assist Pak or the other legal assistants at the firm to send 
any of those misleading communications. While the court disapproves of the wording of the 
communicati ons, that conduct does not constitute theft or conversion , since the evidence 
overwhelmingly supports the finding that Brown agreed to transfer these cases to Norris. If the 
means used were deceptive in any way, that does not transform the transfer itself into actionable 
theft or conversion. The deceived parties, if any, were the clients, not Baird Brown. 
In their closing brief, plaintiffs did not advance any argument that the Norris defendant s
