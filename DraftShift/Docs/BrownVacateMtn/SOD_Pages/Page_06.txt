28 Testimony of Ann Brown 
Plaintiff Ann Brown testified to several key issues in this case. First, she testified that her 
husband did not want to retire when he was first diagnosed with Parkinson's in June 2019, nor at 
any time thereafter. (RT 3/5/25, p. 160:3-p.161 :5.) She acknowledges that her husband had 
back surgery at the end of 2019, from which he had a long recovery period. He could not drive 
for an extended period. (Id., at p. 161 :6-p. 162: 12.) Nonetheless, she claims he never told her 
he wanted to retire. (Id.) She admits that from March 2020 until the early part of 2023, he did 
not go to work except occasionally on weekends. Nonetheless, she claims he still continued to 
work from home and to communicate with Pak on a daily basis and expressed no interest in 
retiring. (Id., at p. 162:6-p. 163: 12.) She maintained this position at trial despite the fact that she 
also acknowledged that in January 2022 her husband developed Covid, "nearly died," was placed 
on a ventilator and had to be hospitalized for a month, after which he was in inpatient care for a 
period of time and then at home receiving therapy. As far as the court can determine , Baird 
Brown appears to have been virtually incapacitated due to Covid for at least 4 to 5 months. (Id., 
at p. 164: 10-167: 10.) Mrs. Brown confirmed that during the entire time that he was hospitalized 
to her knowledge there was no attorney taking responsibility for any of his cases. (Id., at p. 186.) 
Mrs. Brown also claims that she was aware that the Brown firm was purchasing leads in 
the amount of $635,000 in June 2019, which she thought was inadvisable. Her husband told her 
that it was a good business investment. (Id., at p. 169, ln. 17-170, In. 22.) The court found this 
testimony unlikely, given that her testimony was imprecise and she admitted that at this same 
time her husband was not telling her the truth about one key issue -that he was under 
investigation by the state bar and facing a one-year suspension. (TR 3/13/25, p. 133:8-26.) 
Indeed, she only learned about the investigation and his suspension because Pak shared this 
informati on with her when Baird was hospitalized with Covid in 2022; Mrs. Brown 
acknowledged that because her husband was "embarrassed," he hid this information from her for 
three years. (Id.) She also indicated that she had no knowledge of her husband entering any kind 
of relationship with Norris, while it is undisputed from the records that Brown approved the 
substitution of Norris onto the Roh case (discussed below) and signed a written agreement to 
give him 20% of all of proceeds from the Androgel cases. Apparently , there was a lot of 
informati on that Baird did not share with his wife. She also testified that she was aware that her 
husband had been retained by the Mick family in 2014, but that her husband told her he was 
doing nothing on the case. (3/13/25 RT pp. 125-128.) This further supports the court's 
conclusion that Brown knew he needed another attorney to handle cases, the Mick case being 
just one of them. 
Mrs. Brown also acknowledged what was clear from the other evidence -throughout the 
entire period that Baird Brown now claims he was deprived of his case load and deluded about 
Norris's involvement, Baird had full access to SugarSync, his office's case management system, 
and would have seen that legal work was being performed by Norris. In addition, he had access 
to his business and trust accounts and would have seen that he was no longer receiving fees from 
most of his cases. Again, this evidence supports a finding that either Brown thought his cases 
were being magically (and illegally) prosecuted by his legal assistants, or he knew that Norris 
was handling his case load based on their agreement. 
Mrs. Brown testified that she believes that as a result of Pak and Norris's conduct, she
