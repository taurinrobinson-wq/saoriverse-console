28 has been damaged in 
the following ways. She has lost her "retirement" and million s in dollars in 
fees from lucrative cases in which her husband had invested through the purchase of leads. She 
did not quantify her damages further. She did not describe her emotional distress, although it 
was obvious to the court from her testimony that she was deeply upset by the financial straits she 
and her husband now face. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 188-193.) 
Testimony of Carolina Navarro 
Mrs. Brown's testimony was contradicted by that of Carolina Navarro, a former client of 
Mr. Brown's, who worked for the firm in 2019. Navarro testified that in 2019, she was tasked 
with driving Baird Brown to doctor's appointment s, during which he complained to her about 
"shakiness." During this same time, he told her that he was "coming to an end with the law 
firm." (RT 3/7/25. p. 116:17-118 :17.) She also recalls three meetings, either with Brown 
present or with Brown on the phone, in which his leaving the practice of law was discussed: a 
meeting sometime "before summer" of2019; a second meeting over Zoom towards the end of 
2019 where the staff was present in Pak's office and Mr. Brown was on the phone and "a lot of 
cases were discussed" and a third, in person meeting. (Id., p. 118:27-121:28; p. 139:6-141:9.) It 
was at the last meeting that she met Norris for the first time. Navarro places this meeting 
sometime in 2020. At this meeting, Brown and Pak introduced Norris to the office staff, telling 
them that Norris was going to be working on some of their cases. (Id., at p. 138:8 -p. 139:5.) 
She also confirmed that she had a conversation with Mr. Brown and Pak in which she was told 
that some of the 3M cases were going to be transferred to Norris and for her for work on those 
cases with Norris. (Id., at p. 142:2-148:27.) Although Ms. Navarro's dates appeared confused , 
the court found her to be an extremely credible and even guileless witness, who appeared 
genuinely to like and care for Mr. Brown and his wife. 
Testimony of Michelle Pak 
Michelle Pak's testified at length about her dealings with both law firms. She was paid 
50% of the firm's profits from the outset of her job with the Brown Law firm, commencing in 
200 l until late in the "Covid lock down period." (RT 1/27 /25, p. 10: 13-11 :28; RT 1/22/25, p. 
100:1-17; RT 1/22/25, p. 100:18-25.) Pak explained that she oversaw the office and did all of 
the marketing for the firm; she was responsible, she claimed, for bringing in all of the clients for 
the firm's mass tort practice. (RT 2/7/25, p. 69: 12-70:6.) As part of her agreement with Brown, 
she advanced the costs of marketin g and purchasing leads, for which she was reimbursed first 
when the firm received money; after that amount was reimbursed, she received a 50% share of 
the remaining profits. (Id., at p. 70:3-21.) She denied handling any of the legal work, including 
settlements. (Id., at p. 71 :ln 8-72: 5.) 
Pak testified that sometime in May or June 2019, Brown told her that he had been 
diagnosed with Parkinson's and that he was going to be retiring to focus on his health. He 
advised her to find a new attorney to take over their office's mass tort practice and to enter into a 
new profit-sharing arrangement with that attorney. (RT 1/27/25, p. 50:16-55:20; RT 2/5/25, p. 
17: 19-21: 12.) He told her he was very fatigued and needed to engage in many treatments to 
address his health condition and so intended to retire. (2/7/25 RT p. 75:17-77:5.) Perhaps 
inconsistently, she testified that he appeared very strong and healthy, went to the gym every day 
and was still actively managing his case load during this period. (Id., at p. 77: 12 to 78:2.) Luc 
Granillo confirmed that in the first few months of 2020, Brown hobbled a pit and his hands
