28 25-26.) Moreover, she testified that there is a distinction between an attorney being suspended 
from the practice of law and an attorney withdrawing from representing a client. Suspension 
does not automatically mean that the attorney must withdraw. (Id., at p. 38:27-39:23.) 
On these same lines, Bucker explained that there is no California case deciding whether an 
attorney who has been suspended from the practice of law is entitled to fees earned prior to that 
suspension. (Id., at p. 40: 1-14.) Decisions from other jurisdiction s, except for Texas, allow an 
attorney to obtain fees for work performed prior to a suspension. (Id., at p. 44: 1-14.) 
Buckner also expressed the opinion that it is permissible under Rule of Professional Conduct 
5.4 for a non-lawyer such as Pak to enter into an agreement with a law firm by which the non­
lawyer receives a percentage of the profits or net revenue. She qualified this, however, by stating 
that it is impermissible for a non-lawy er to receive a percentage of an attorney fee award or 
payment of fees on a specific case or specific legal matters. (Id., at p. 37:3 -38: 15.) Reviewing 
the agreement signed by Pak in July 2019 (but not Norris), Buckner opined that this arrangement 
(90% of net profits of the mass tort practice) would violate Rule 5.4 since it relates to specific 
cases (the mass tort practice). (Id.) 
Ultimately, much of Buckner's opinion was irrelevant. While the court would agree that 
mere suspension for a three month period does not equate with an automatic withdraw al from 
representation or nullify attorney fees earned in the period before the suspension, as explained 
elsewhere in this opinion the court concludes that Brown agreed to withdraw from most of his 
case, including all the mass tort cases, and to transfer most of his open cases to the Norris law 
firm. Thus, the court is presented with the question whether Brown is entitled to a share of the 
fees on cases where he voluntarily withdrew from representing the client. 
On this issue, Norris presented the testimony of Joel Osman, who the court accepted as an 
expert on legal ethics generally, and more specifically on the issue of quantum meruit recovery 
in this case. (RT 3/13/25, p. 7: 13-11: 10.) Osman explained that under the rules of professional 
conduct, an attorney may withdraw, but if they do so voluntarily, they are not entitled to recover 
for work done prior to their withdrawa l, even under a quantum meruit theory. In so opining, 
Osman relied on the Falco case, which was also supported by a more recent case out of the 
United States Bankruptc y Court, In re Michael David Paris, 568 B.R. 810 (U.S. Bankruptcy Ct. 
C.D. Cal. 2017). (Id., at pp. 11 :1-21:25.) 
The general rule in California is that "an attorney who withdraws voluntarily without cause 
forfeits recovery for services performed." (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1015.) 
The courts have grappled with what constitutes "good cause," and have agreed that withdrawal 
due to ethical concerns about the client's behavior (not present here) would constitute good 
cause. (Id.) This court could not find any California case to discuss whether ill health 
constitutes good cause to withdraw. 
If the facts of this case were that Brown was too ill to continue to represent the clients at 
issue here, and that there were no other factors present, the court might well conclude that Brown 
was entitled to fees under a quantum meruit theory. However, the court finds that Brown 
withdrew because he wanted to retire, he was facing a state bar investigation and he ultimately 
was suspended for several months. By his own admission and the testimony of his wife and 
doctor, Brown was not too ill to continue to handle these cases in 2019 and 2020, had he chosen
