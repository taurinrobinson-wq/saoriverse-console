28 tenant with the Brown Law Firm. While not formally approved by the landlord, the court finds 
that the agreement between Brown and Norris was that Norris could also use the suite to conduct 
his practice. (RT 2/28/25, p. 49-51.) 
One of Norris's claims is that cross-defendants' actions on October 21, 2023 constituted a 
"forced entry." Although this is not a separate cause of action, cross-defendants failed to 
establish that the incidents on October 21, 2023 should be viewed as a "forced entry." Brown 
and his agents had a lawful right to be on the premises, which were leased to Brown, bore his 
name on the outer doors as the only occupant, and for which he was paying some portion of the 
monthly rent. 
The undisputed evidence established that after entering the premises, cross-defendants took 
possession of everything in the suite, including certain files and other personal property 
belonging to Norris and his law firm. According ly, the court finds that cross-complainants did 
establish their claim that cross-defendants Baird Brown and Ann Brown collectively converted 
certain of their personal property, in violation of Civil Code Section 3336. (See below for 
discussion of the liability of Andrew and Jonathan White for conversion. ) 
Norris testified that the cost ofreplacing lost office furniture was $50,000. (RT 3/5/25 p. 
120: 1-50.) The court found this testimony not credible, given that all evidence points to Norris 
merely moving into and occupying an existing office suite paid for and furnished by the Brown 
Law offices. No credible evidence was presented that the furnishings and office equipment in 
those buildings was paid for by anyone other than the Brown Law Offices. As stated 
previously , the court discounts Pak's testimony in this regard, as she was a thoroughly unreliable 
witness. 
However , Norris testified credibly that his firm had to expend time and effort to try to rebuil 
the files, contact clients, and reestablish a new office. Norris testified that it took his firm three to 
four months to reconstruct their files and get their new office up and running. His staff was 
working full time on this project, with a total monthly payroll cost of $20,204. (RT 3/7 /25 
pp.161-I 62.) Norris also explained that they had to incur additional costs to advertise their 
move to the new suite of offices, or $8850. (Id., at pp. 163-165; and Exh. 15562.) These 
damages are recoverab le, in the court's opinion, as money spent "in pursuit" of reconstructing 
the personal property taken from them. 
The court also found credible Norris's testimony that they had to purchase supplies, which 
more likely than not, had been purchased by Pak and Norris over the prior three years and not by 
the Brown Fim1, for an additional expense of $25,375, as well as computers , or $6241.75.910 The 
9 The court finds cross-defendants have not established that they are entitled to cost of parking, 
telephone, insurance, or CCTV, since all of these costs would have been incurred in any event 
even if they had remained sharing the Brown Law suite of offices. 
10 An inordinate amount of time was spent at trial by Brown's attorneys trying to establish that 
several of the invoices presented for computers were falsified, including presentation of a 
forensic computer expert, Bruce Pixley. While the court found Pixley's testimony credible, it 
did little to persuade the court that Pak or Norris had falsified the records or directed someone to 
do that; the court finds it more likely that when Pak asked for back up invoices, the computer
