28 would have made it more likely that clients would agree to the transfer. Norris deni_ed having
any knowledge about thecreation of tthe website all of which was handled bya designer hiredby 
Pak. He testified credibly that whilethe website was modeled after Brown s, any inclusion of a 
photo of Brown was inadvertent and likely not visible to the public.(RT 3/5/25, p. 26:21-p. 
28:6.) Indeed, he claimed he would not have wanted Brown on his website because of Browns 
discipline record. (Id., asp. 53.) 
Ultimately, the court found Pixley's testimony did not support Brown's theory of the case in 
any meaningful way. 
Testimony of Lucas Granillo 
Lucas Granillo was called by plaintiffs to testify about his experiences as a legal assistant at 
the Brown law firm. Granillo started with the Brown firm in 2017 and left in May or June of 
2020. (RT 2/10/25 p.m., pp. 234: 16 -235:4.) He testified that during his employment with the 
firm, Pak directed all his work, not Brown. However, if he did something that had to go to court, 
he believes Brown would review it. (Id., at pp. 235:20-236:24.) 
Sometime in 2020 (if not earlier), the office began the process of transferring Brown's cases 
to Norris. Pak told Granillo that Brown wanted his mass tort cases transferred to Norris. She 
told him this change was due to Brown's health issues which made it hard for him to practice law 
and because he had a suspension approaching. Granillo never heard this directly from Brown. 
(RT 2/10/25 at p. 242: 1-24.) Pak directed him to contact the mass tort clients and tell them that 
"Mr. Norris is going to absorb and take over Mr. Brown's mass tort claims, and that ... the same 
staff and the same office were going to be working the cases." (Id., at p. 243:6-21.) He 
confirmed that the various email communications with clients and scripts introduced into 
evidence were generally the types of communications that Pak directed him to send to existing 
clients to persuade them to transfer their cases to Norris. He confirmed that Norris was not an 
associate of the firm, nor a branch or division of the Brown firm. (RT 2/14/25, pp. 67-87.) 
Granillo also confirmed that though he worked on legal matters for the Norris law firm at times 
before his departure in June 2020, he was always paid with a check drawn from the Baird Brown 
law firm. This amount was never quantified. (Id., at pp. 87-88.) 
Testimony of Taurin Robinson 
Defendant Taurin Robinson, a law clerk with the firm, also provided testimony. He 
explained that he worked for the Brown firm from 2017 until the end of 2020. (RT 2/28/25 pp. 
58:21 -59:20.) He began to work as a legal assistant for the Norris firm in January 2021. (Id.) 
He explained that he did some work "here and there" for Brown after the suspension. (Id., at pp. 
59:1-60:11.) His paychecks throughout 2020 were issued by the Brown law firm. However , he 
contends that when he did work for Norris, he was separately paid by Norris. (Id. at p. 60: 12-
23 .) Robinson , like Granillo, was asked to communicate with clients to ensure their smooth 
transition to the Norris law firm. (Id., at pp. 63-67, 70.) Robinson testified that he believed what 
he was doing was in Brown's best interest and at his instruction because Brown told them to 
transfer the cases to Norris's firm. (Id., at p, 74:16-75:15.) He denied Brown having any 
memory issues in 2019 and 2020. (Id., at p. 79.) 
Robinson claims that he participated in a Zoom meeting sometime during the early part of
