28 18:2.)7 While Norris declined to sign this agreement which would have given Pak 90% of his 
practice's net profits, after cases settled, it was his practice to decide a "fair" amount to pay Pak 
based on the hours she had worked and other unspecified factors. He also sought to ensure that 
she was repaid for any loans she had made to the firm or advanced to buy leads. (RT 3/5/25 at 
pp. 62-65.) 
Norris was aware that Brown's cases were being transferred to him, commencing in the 
firstquarter of 2020, although there may have been a few that transferred in December 2019. 
Brown never voiced any objection to the transfer and Norris believed that he was fully on board 
with the plan to wind down his practice and transfer his cases to Norris. (RT 3/5/25, p. 18:3 -
19:28.) Norris played no role in the transfers, which were handled entirely by Brown's office 
staff. He denies directing the process or being involved in the paperwork or interactions with 
clients. (id. and RT 3/5/25, pp. 82:24-83:6.) There was no evidence presented by plaintiff to 
show that he participated in the process. 
Although Norris had wanted to move all of the case files to his own office in downtown 
Los Angeles, Pak persuaded Norris to continue to continue to handle the cases out of the Brown 
law offices in Korea town. She told Norris that Brown felt more comfortable keeping them in 
his own office because they had once been his clients and he wanted Norris to continue to use his 
staff to work on those cases. (RT 3/5/25, at p. 59.) Norris never discussed the rent of the Korea 
town offices with Brown. Instead, Pak told him that "she was covering it." He does recall being 
asked to pay $15,000 towards the rent at some point by Pak, which he did, but he does not recall 
the specifics. (id., at p. 59:26-60:24.) He did not provide any testimony or evidence to 
establish that he paid any other office expenses, rent, or staff costs for the Wilshire Avenue 
offices during the period in question (April 2020 to October 21, 2023). 
Norris confirmed that Brown represented Norris and Brown in malpractice litigation 
brought against both of them by an heir to one of their clients, known as the "Mick case." 
(3/5/25 pp. 21 :8.-p. 22: 13.) Throughout his representation of Norris on that case, Brown never 
mentioned that he believed he should have been paid by Norris for any of the cases Norris had 
been handling. (id.) 
Norris was not present when the Browns and their attorneys went to the offices on 
Wilshire on October 21, 2023, and ejected Pak and Norris. He met with the Whites a few days 
afterwards at Starbucks. At that meeting, the Whites accused Norris of having stolen cases from 
Brown, which Norris denied; he explained to the Whites that the cases had been transferred to 
him by Brown. Norris told the Whites that there were many files in the office belonging to his 
clients -clients who had never been represented by the Brown law firm -to which he needed 
access. The Whites agreed that Norris could go with them to the suite to identify those files, 
which they did that same day, but Norris claims he was only provided 45 minutes to go through 
7The court observes that both firm's agreements with Pak were unsavory and may have 
bordered on unethical. Because both firms appeared to employ this same unusual business 
model of paying for leads to solicit clients and then at times appearing to pay Pak, a non-lawyer, 
a percentage of fees recovered, neither complained about the other's practices or presented law 
or argument about these practices. Accordingly , the court does not express any opinion or 
findings about the legality or ethics of these practices, beyond observing that both lawyers seem 
to have used poor judgment and disregard of ethical constrictions in their involvement with Pak.
