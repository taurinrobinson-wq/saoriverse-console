26 27 case violated her fiduciary duty to Brown. As stated throughout the opinion, the court finds that 
Brown acquiesced in the transfer 
of his cases to the Norris firm because_ of his health issues,the
state bar investigation and his understanding that he did not have the ability to contmue to litigate 
these cases. There was no evidence that Pak used undue influence on the Roh family or that 
Brown was unaware of the transfer. If Brown truly believed he was still representing Roh, he 
would have exercised his professional obligations to keep abreast of the case and would have 
immediately seen that a substitution had been filed, replacing his office with the Norris law firm. 
Had Brown believed that he was still responsible for the case, he would have known that 
settlement and litigation activity was taking place without him. The fact that he did nothing is 
irrefutable evidence that he consented to the substitution. There can be no breach of a fiduciary 
duty where the party to whom the duty is owed consents to the conduct about which he later 
complains. 
D. Elder Financial Abuse Against All Defendants (Cal. Welfare & Inst. Code§ 15600 et 
seq.) 
Under Welfare and Institution s Code section 15610.30 , to establish elder abuse, Plaintiffs 
were required to prove that Defendant s took, appropriated, obtained, or retained property for a 
wrongful use or with the intent to defraud or by undue influence, that Mr. Brown was 65 years or 
older at the time, and that Defendants' conduct was a substantial factor in causing harm. 
Plaintiffs failed to prove that Norris or Pak wrongfully obtained any clients or retained funds 
received in settlement for those clients which rightfully belonged to plaintiffs. The court finds 
that Baird Brown willingly transferred the contested cases to Norris, commencing in 2019, 
because of his desire to wind down his practice and withdraw from the active practice of law 
given his significant health issues, and later, his suspension by the state bar. While Brown's 
cognitive function was profoundly impaired at trial and the court finds, was significantly 
impaired as early as January 2022 when he nearly died from Covid, he was functioning well 
enough in 2019 and 2020 to understand that he was voluntarily transferring his cases to Norris, 
to cooperate in that process, and to negotiate many aspects of it. 
As discussed above, trial testimony from Dr. Lombard and Ann Brown confirmed that 
Brown maintained sufficient cognitive ability to understand the transition of his practice in 2020. 
(RT 1/22/25, 84:9-85:9, 88: 10-11, 87: 16-88:28; 3/13/25, 129: 17-131 :20.) Brown executed a 
declaration pursuant to Rule 9.20 confirming his notification of clients, and Substitution of 
Attorney forms were properly processed and filed. (Def. Exs. 15503, 15508, 15555; Pl. Exs. 
1653-1655.) The evidence demonstrates a consensual transfer. Additionally, witness Rhonda 
Lewis confirmed that Brown told clients directly in 2019 that he was retiring and transferring 
their cases to Norris. (RT 3/14/25 PM, 16:25-27, 24:1-3; Def. Ex. 15565.) Similarly, Granillo 
and Robinson testified that Brown did not exhibit any mental decline during the 2019 to 2020 
period when the cases were transferred. Anyone dealing with Brown during those years, 
including but not limited to Pak and Norris, would reasonably have believed that he had full 
capacity to make the decision to wind down his practice and transfer his cases. 
Although plaintiffs failed to establish any conduct by the Norris defendants that would 
amount to financial elder abuse, they did establish that Pak's conduct violated the act. 
As stated above, the court finds that Pak breached her fiduciary duty to Brown in her 
28 handling of the rental payments and in her use of firm funds to purchase leads in 2019 for the
