28 copy of his client files -files to which he contends they had no right of access and should only 
have been able to obtain with a court order. (Id.) Nonetheless, the court finds that at least some 
of the files he claims were not returned to him, in fact were returned to him only a few days after 
the October 21, 2023 incident, including client files of clients he claims he could not contact, 
undermining his claim that he lost contact with all 200 clients. (RT 3/13/25 at pp. 52-63.) 
Norris testified that because of plaintiffs' takeover of their office and files, they lost 13 7 
clients from the Camp Lejeune litigation relating to toxic ground water -clients who they had 
obtained by paying a company for "leads." All of these clients, Norris testified, had agreed to be 
represented by the Norris firm and had signed retainer agreements with the firm. (3/5/25 p. 120: 
18-130:18, and Exhs. 15526 and 15527.) They had paid $200,000 for leads to potential clients in 
this case, from which they had obtained 500 clients, but lost contact with 137 after 10/31/23. 
(Id.) Norris testified that they had paid $50,000 for leads to clients in the Boy Scouts of America 
cases, $100,000 for clients in the "firefighters' litigation, " and $50,000 for hernia mesh leads, 
although Norris conceded he had not been able to quantity how many clients the lost from the 
hernia mesh litigation. (RT 3/5/25, pp.123:20-128 :10.) He also did not quantify how many of 
these clients were actually retained as a result of these leads, nor did he testify clearly about the 
steps taken to connect with them. He explained that for cases in which work had commenced, 
that work would be in the SugarSync system which they lost access to after October 21, 2023; 
for other clients, their information would have been on computers, but not on the computers 
given back to them by the Whites. They did contact the lead firms from which they had 
purchased the client's names and information and were able to contact some clients by those 
means. Nonetheless, clients dropped them either because they were upset about the lack of 
contact or because the Norris firm had lost their files on October 21, 2023; Norris claims there 
were four boxes of client documents to which he was denied access, a point conceded by 
plaintiff Ann Brown. (RT 3/7/25, pp. 14-25, and Exh. 15525.) 
Ultimately, Norris testified that he was able to identify 200 clients for which they had a 
retainer agreement or knew that they had been retained even if the retainer agreement could not 
be found -all clients who later dropped the firm, he claims. (Id., at p. 25-29.) To quantify the 
financial loss suffered by his firm as a result of the loss of these clients, Norris simply multiplied 
the number of lost clients times the amount paid per lead, for a total claimed loss of $605,074.) 
(Id., atp. 152:4-159:1 and Exh. 15561.) 
Although the evidence presented of the Browns withholding files and disrupting Norris's 
ability to contact his clients is sufficient to establish a claim for conversion , the court finds 
Norris has not established actual damages. 
Cross-complainants contend that they are not seeking speculative damages (for example, the 
amounts they might have recovered had they been able to continue their representation of these 
clients uninterrupted), but only their out-of-pocket costs in paying for these leads in the first 
instance. The court agrees that in principle, the out-of-pocket costs of paying for leads would be 
compensable based on wrongful interference with Norris Law Corporation's business. 
Nonetheless, the court finds that cross-complainants have not proven actual damages as a result 
of the wrongful retention of their files because cross-defendants have established that the Norris 
cross-complainants could have mitigated their damages but failed to do so. The court notes that 
Civil Code Section 3336 (Conversion) requires the plaintiff to establish the amount "sufficient to 
indemnify the party injured for the loss which is the natural, reasonable and proximate result of
