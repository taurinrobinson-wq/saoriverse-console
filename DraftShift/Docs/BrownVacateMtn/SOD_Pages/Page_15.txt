27 the Covid lockdown (and Brown's suspension) when they were all working from home; Brown 
instructed them during this call to transfer all of the cases to Norris.6 During this call Brown 
instructed them on how to transfer the cases, expressed a disinterest in continuing to practice law 
and told them that if they had any questions regarding cases to take the questions to Pak. (RT 
2/28/25, at pp. 80:2-83:3.) He explained that the process of transferring cases was confusing and 
difficult, but the staff did the best they could. (id., at pp. 83-84.) He clarified that Brown was 
fairly hands off in the transfer process but nonetheless directing it. Norris played no role in 
directing the transfer process. (Id., at pp. 88:4 -89:4.) 
Testimony of Donald G. Norris 
Norris was questioned at length about his role in the transfer of cases and his counterclaims . 
His testimony was at times argumentative, self-serving or evasive. Some of this may be 
explained by the considerable hostility expressed by all of the attorneys towards each other -
clients and their counsel -which may have made Norris unusually combative. Thus, he was 
unnecessarily cautious about identifying documents and sometimes contradicted himself about 
what he had signed and what he had not signed. This caution made him appear evasive or less 
than credible at times. 
Nonetheless , Norris did present credible testimony about his first encounter with 
Michelle Pak and the process by which he agreed to undertake to continue to represent many of 
Brown's clients as Brown wound down his law practice. Norris met Pak in May or June 2019, 
through an introduction by a mutual friend. (RT 3/5/25 at pp. 5-6.) Norris had known Brown by 
reputation previously and had even referred cases to him, as he knew him to be a competent and 
experienced attorney. (Id .. ) Pak told him that Brown wanted to stop practicing law, as he had 
recently been diagnosed with Parkinson's and he was looking for someone to transfer hundreds 
of cases too, many of which were product liability mass tort cases. Pak proposed that she remain 
as an office manager to manage the staff and obtain leads. He believes at their first meeting she 
proposed the same type of financial arrangement she had with Brown, namely a 50/50 split. (RT 
3/5/25 at pp. 6-9.) 
Norris told Pak he was interested in the prospect, and she arranged a meeting in the 
second or third week of July between Brown and Norris. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 12-13.) Before the 
meeting, Pak assured Norris that Brown wanted to go ahead with transferring the cases. (RT 
3/5/25, pp. 15:27-16:4.) At the meeting in July 2019, Brown told Norris that he did not want to 
practice anymore and that he intended to retire. He stated that he wanted to transfer his cases 
over to Brown and would do whatever was needed to facilitate the transfer. Norris explained 
that he was interested but not certain he wanted all the cases, as he did not know anything about 
them. (RT 3/5/25 at pp. 12-13.) Significantly, Norris admitted that Pak began to purchase 
leads for his firm in June 2019, well before the meeting between Norris and Brown. He claims 
that Pak told him that Brown had given his blessing to this arrangement. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 131-
132.) Pak told him that she was paying for leads using her own money, but did not disclose to 
him that she was passing that money through the Brown business account. (Id., at pp. 133-136.) 
Norris viewed the money that Pak paid for leads to obtain clients to be loans to his law firm, 
which would have to be repaid. (3/5/25 at pp. 137-142.) 
28 6Granillo denied being present on such a Zoom call or ever hearing that such a call had taken 
place. (3/7/25 Tr., pp. 30: 17-31 :21.)
