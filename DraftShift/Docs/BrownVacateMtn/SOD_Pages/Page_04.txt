28 authorizing anyone to tell clients in oneoftheir masstort cases ("3Mm_ilitary e_arbuds") thathe 
was transferring the case from one div1s1on of hislaw firm to the Norns associate branch. (Id., 
at 109:2-10.) Nonetheless, he acknowledged that he wrote Exhibit 1638, an email toa legal. 
assistant with his firm, revising the notice he had to send to clients as a result of hissuspension, 
which specifically named Don Norris (and another attorney) as attorneys to contact "if anything 
comes up with [the client's] case" during his three months suspension. (Exh. 1638, 1/22/25, pp. 
110:3-113:9.) While he claims he had no knowledge that Pak was going to be working for 
Norris as his office manager in the April 2020 time frame, he admitted that Pak had shown him
the draft of an agreement she and Norris were drawing up in the July 2019 time frame. (1/22/25 
at 113:10-114:28.)1 
The court also received into evidence Exhibit 1573, a series of text messages between 
Brown and Pak. Tellingly, on April 26, 2020, Pak and Norris have an exchange in which Pak 
criticized Brown for making a "business deal with Jeff David" and referring "questions cases to 
him." She asserted "our clients already have own new lawyer why they asking questions to their 
case to Jeff." Instead of denying that the clients had a new attorney, Brown responded: "No 
arrangement with Jeff. He would be backup if DN is not available or not interested "Exh. 
1573, p. 3 (emphasis added.).) This text was followed by a barrage of text messages from Pak 
over the next two months, talking about the problems with various cases, including statute of 
limitation problems and 154 cases with serious problems which had been transferred into 
Norris's name. Brown's only response was to direct her to transfer the problematic cases back to 
him. At no time in this series of text messages over this several month period did Brown express 
any discomfort or disagreement with the transfer of cases to Norris, nor did he give Pak any real 
guidance about what to do with the SOL problems and other legal problems she was finding. 
This series of text messages is strong evidence that Brown agreed that the cases should be 
transferred to Norris and that he was providing little to no oversight to Pak, a nonlawyer, about 
what to do with the remaining cases or questions that were being raised and problems that were 
being uncovered. 
Brown also admitted that he entered into an agreement with Norris on November 16, 
2020 whereby Brown agreed to accept 80% of all attorney fees received relative to the Androge l 
testosterone gel mass tort cases previously handled by Brown's office. (RT 1 /22/25, p. 1I7:10-
1 19: 15 and Exh. I.) He could not recall any conversations with Pak about the percentage chosen 
but agrees he voluntarily signed this agreement. Upon further examination at trial, he confessed 
that he has no memory of this agreement or the Androgel case. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 38:2-41 :6.) 
Although he acknowledges his signature on the document, he does not have any memory of 
1 Both counsel for Pak and Brown expressed some consternation on the record about Brown's 
testimony in this regard, and the court expressed concern that Brownwas not reviewing 
documents before testifying about them, but Brown's attorney did not seek to withdraw Brown 
as a witness or to clarify or correct this testimony on the day it was given. Thus, Brown testified 
that he was aware in July 2019 that Pak and Norris were drawing up an agreement to give her 
90% ofNorris's mass tort practice, when supposedly Pak was still working for Brownto develop 
and maintain his mass tort practice. On the following day of testimony, clearly after coaching by 
his counsel, Brown testified that he had not seen this document until it was produced in 
discovery. (1/23/25 at p. 21:16-28.) The court places little weight on Brown's admission in 
court, as he appears to lack the mental capacity to understand much of what he was saying or 
being asked.
