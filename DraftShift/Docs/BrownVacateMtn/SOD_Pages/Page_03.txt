28 individua ls in the past. (Id., at 89: 1-89:25.) However , Dr. Lombard believed if he had de1:1entia , 
it was only in an early stage. (Id., at 90:6-12.) Dr. Lombard, however , admitted that he himself 
had no memory of his patient's health situation in the critical time period, 2019 to 2020,and. 
testified that he saw him only rarely. Or. Lombard' s testimony was further undermined by his 
utter lack of familiarity with his own patient's chart: for example, he indicated that Brown had 
had no significant health history, apparently not knowing about the many months in critical care, 
the lengthy hospitalization and extended rehab due to Covid in 2022, including extended time on 
a respirator, as well as plaintiff s multiple back surgeries. (Id., at p. 87: 16-88:28.) The court 
finds that Dr. Lombard is either insufficientl y familiar with his patients' records or mistaken if he 
believes Brown is only showing mild cognitive decline; Mr. Brown displayed significant 
cognitive impairment while testifying. 
Mrs. Brown testified that while she observed some signs of Parkinson's-related 
motor symptoms in 2019, Mr. Brown's cognition remained steady and did not significantly 
decline until late 2022, following his "near death" experience with Covid-19, sometime mid-
2022. (RT 3/5/25, p. 188, In. 12-16; RT 3/13/25, p. 129:17-131:20.) Although she then changed 
her testimony somewhat and said that she did not notice a cognitive impairment until sometime 
in 2023 (RT 3/5/25, p. 188-189), she later reaffirmed that her husband began to be cognitively 
impaired in 2022. (RT 3/13/25 at p. 130: 5-24.) 
Given this testimony (and that of the three legal assistants--Granillo, Navarro and Robinson-­
discussed below), the court conclude s that plaintiff was beginning to show many symptoms of 
Parkinson 's in 2019 and before, but that he continued to present as a cognitively functionin g 
individual and was able to conduct routine legal business through at least 2020, as demonstrated 
by the various documents he was drafting in that period. By the second day of his testimony at 
trial, it appeared to the court that he had very little recollection of the events that occurred in 
2019 through 2023. For example, he could not even recall whether he "practiced law" in 2021, 
2022 or 2023, the years in which his lawyers contend he was still able to practice but had his 
clients stolen from him. (RT 1/23/25, p. 42:2-12.) Accordingly , the court could give little 
weight to his testimony, except where it was corroborated by other testimony or evidence. 
Brown testified that he recognized the lease to the suite of offices he rented in 2019 on 
Wilshire Blvd.. He claims he never agreed that Norris could take over the lease or become a 
subtenant, which would have required written authorization from the landlord based on the 
written terms of the lease. (RT 1/22/25, p. 95:18-98: 28, and Exh. 19.) He also explained that he 
never said Norris could use his law firm's personnel. (Id., at 103:15 -21.) But later, somewhat 
inconsistently, he testified that he told Norris that Norris could use Brown's rented offices for 
Norris's law practice "several years into the lease term." (Id., at 103:1-20.) 
At trial Brown claimed that he had no knowledge of any deal to transfer his cases to 
Norris. He claims Pak never told him that her agreement with the Baird firm had terminated. 
(RT 1/22/25, p. 101 :2-7.) He denies ever having a meeting with Pak and Norris to discuss 
transfer of cases to Norris. (Id., at 102: 23-27.) He never agreed to transfer the "bulk of his" 
cases to Norris. (Id., at 102:28-103: l 0.) He never told anyone that Norris was a litigator with 
his firm, nor did he authorize anyone to tell third parties that Norris was a litigator with his firm. 
(Id., at p. 105:2-16.) When shown Exhibit 1379, he testified that he did not authorize anyone to 
send this letter but then conceded that the signature at the bottom could be his own. He claimed 
to have no recollection of the letter. (Id., at p. 105:26- p. 107:15, and Exh. 1379.) He denies I 4
