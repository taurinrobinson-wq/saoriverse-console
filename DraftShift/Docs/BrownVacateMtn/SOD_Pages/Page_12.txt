28 used to solicit them to transfer their case to Norris. (RT 2/14/25 Tr, p. 130-133, Exh. 1681 and 
1682.)4 She was part of the discussion between Norris and Brownin which Brown
communicated that he wanted Norris to take over some of hiscases. She claims that she was not 
present during any discussion of the actual terms of the transfer. After the threeof them met on 
July 11, they walked around the office and introduced Norris to the staff. She wasnever present 
at any discussion, nor did she see anything in writing between Brown and Noms about the terms 
of their transfer arrangement. (Id., at p. 93, ln. 23-p. 95, In. 12.) Legal Assistant Lucas Granillo, 
when questioned about this event, stated that he never saw Brown and Pak introduce Norris to 
the office staff and never heard that it had happened in July 2019 or at any other time. (2/14/25 
Tr, p. 90, In. 17-p. 92, ln. 17.) 
She claims Brown told her to "finishup" all of his individual personal injury cases, settling 
the medical liens and completing the settlements, allowing her to continue to use the law offices' 
space and personnel to do that while she was simultaneously helping Norris assume 
responsibility for the mass tort cases and to buy new leads to increase that case load. (RT 2/7/25 
at p. 100: 1-103:6.) Brown knew that Norris would be using the same office space, directing 
Pak to make sure that the receptionist answered the phone with both the law firm of Baird Brown 
and the law firm of Donald Norris. (Id., at p. 103:7-18 .) She testified that once he was 
suspended, Brown directed her to transfer the remainin g of the PI cases to Norris, with each 
office paying for the staff time devoted to their cases. (Id., at p. l 05:3-16.) 
She claims that Norris did not actually start working on the mass tort cases until after 
Brown's suspension on April 1, 2020. (2/7/25 RT at p. 95:13-25.) Pak testified (and it was 
undisputed by Brown) that Brown did not come into the office during ordinary work hours after 
he was suspended for more than threeyears. She did not see him in the office again until 
October 21, 2023, when he came with attorneys and his wife to reclaim the space. (Id., at p. 
105: 19 -106: 18.)5 She did continue to communicate him throughout 2020 and 2021. She claims 
work was sti II being done on some of his cases (presumably by legal assistants and not Brown), 
and that he continued to get paid on those cases. (Id., at p. 106: 19 -109:25.) 
Pak concedes that communications were sent to clients of the Baird Brown law firm as early 
as January 2020, informing them that their case was being transferred to the Norris firm. She 
claims that all these letters were first approved by Brown. The court agrees with Brown's 
counsel that the letters were slightly misleading in that they suggested that Norris had been an 
associated counsel with the Brown firm previously or that his law firm was already part of the 
4 Although Pak did not admit this, the court concludes that she likely purchased the leads in Ma 
with the intent that they be used by Brown,but when Norris agreed to take over the practice, she 
then began to identify and treat these as leads purchased for Norris. The court does not find that 
she was prescient about being able to work with Norris, or that Norris had a deal or 
understanding prior to June 2019 that they would be working together in any capacity. 
5Having first said that she did not see Brown once between April 1, 2020 and October 21, 2023 
Pak then changed her testimony and said he came onto the office every day. When the court 
pointed out the inconsistency in her testimony, she corrected herself to say that she never saw 
him but he was coming in on the weekend , that he continued to do payroll and was giving 
direction to staff over the phone. (Id., at p. 105: 19 -106: 18.) The court placed little weight on 
her testimony as to Brown's level of involvement, since it was contradictory and not credible.
