28 team to show that he had in fact performed legal work on a single case after his suspension on 
April 1, 2020. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 54:21-62:10.) 
Also very telling is Brown's agreement with Norris on the Androgel case. The parties 
signed a written agreement, which Brown did not dispute, giving Norris 20% of the fees to be 
recovered on these cases. Not only does this completely bely Brown's claim that he had no 
meetings or agreement with Norris in the 2019 period, but it also supports defendants ' contention 
that Brown understood he needed help and needed to transfer his cases to a new lawyer; why 
would a healthy active attorney who had performed considerable work on lucrative mass tort 
litigation give 20% of the future recovery to an attorney he did not know, who would do nothing 
on the case? 
Brown admitted that he did represent Norris in a legal malpractice case brought against 
Brown and Norris relating to a case referred to as the "Mick case." (RT 1/22/25 p. 128:6-132: 
4.) He admitted to filing an answer on behalf of himself and Norris in December 2020. (1/27/25 
am, p. 72:6 -76:2, and Exh. 15534.) He claims that Norris was unhelpful in providing him with 
information and that he had no idea Norris had any involvement in the Mick litigation. (Id.) The 
court finds this hard to believe given that Brown admitted that he undertook to represent both of 
them when the Mick family filed suit against them for missing the statute of limitation s. The 
court questions why Brown would represent Norris unless he thought Norris was working on the 
case either as his associate or co-counsel. Brown never explained why he would represent Norris 
if he had no relationship with Norris or knowledge that Norris had assumed responsibility for 
any of his cases. 
Brown also admitted on cross-examination that in the 2020 period, he received emails from 
the Law Offices of Don Norris, attaching draft notices of letters to send to clients. One of those 
letters informed clients that Brown had been suspended from practice; the other advised that 
Brown would be "stepping away from [the] case" and advising them that Norris would be 
contacting them to discuss transfer of the case to Norris. (Exh. 15505.) Even though these were 
not the ultimate notices sent to clients, they do show that Norris and Brown were in email 
discussion s about how best to inform clients of Brown's suspension and to transition the work to 
Norris. (RT 1/23/25 p. 43:3 -45:23.) Brown did not deny that he had received these emails. In 
addition, the court received into evidence text messages between Pak and Brown from the June 
2020 period where they discussed transferring cases to and from the Norris office. (RT 1/28/25 
p. 31 :2-38:6 and Exh. 1573, pp. 6-8.) 
Brown admitted that he continued to have access to his bank accounts (business and client 
trust accounts) in 2019 and 2020. (RT 1/23/25 at p. 51: 2-24.) When shown his business bank 
account statements for 2020 and 202 I, which showed a precipitou s reduction in revenue, he 
conceded that he had access to these accounts but does not recall there being a reduction of 
income. (RT 1/28/25 at pp. 18:5 -22:8.) The court concludes from these records that either 
Brown did not bother to look at them because he was utterly disengaged from his practice, or he 
looked at them and was not bothered by what he saw, because he knew that his law practice had 
been effectively transferred to Norris, thereby necessarily reducing his income. 
Indeed, had Brown been actively engaged in any of his federal mass tort cases, he would 
have seen that substitutions of counsel had been filed in each of them, replacing his name as 
counsel of record with that of Donald Norris. The execution of substitutions of attorney further
