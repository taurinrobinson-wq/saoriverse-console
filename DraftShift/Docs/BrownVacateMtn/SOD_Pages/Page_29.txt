28 Norris firm in the amount 
of $188,500. Elder financial abuse under Welfare and Institutions 
Code Section 15600, et seq. includes the wrongful taJ<ing of "real or personal property of an 
elder by undue influence as defined in Section 15610.70." Section 15610.30(b) provides that "A 
person or entity shall be deemed to have taken, secreted, appropriated , obtained, or retained 
property for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person or entity takes, secretes, 
appropriates, obtains, or retains the property and the person or entity knew or should have known 
that this conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder or dependent adult." 
Plaintiff established that Pak's breach of her fiduciary duty to Brown constitutes financial 
elder abuse within the meaning of the statute. The court notes that plaintiffs did not establish 
that Norris participated in the wrongful taking, or that he knew the source of the money used to 
purchase leads or understood that Pak was using Brown's money to pay the lease for his office. 
Thus, Norris is not liable under the Elder Abuse statute. 
Because plaintiffs established by a preponderance of the evidence that Pak engaged in 
conduct which amounts to elder financial abuse, "as defined in Section 15610.30, in addition to 
compensatory damages and all other remedies otherwise provided by law, the court shall award 
to the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs."(§ 15657.5, subd. (a), italics added.) "The 
attorney fee provision in section 15657.5 is not discretionary in nature." (Arace v. Medico 
Investments, LLC. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 977, 983.) Pak is also potentially liable for treble 
damages under Civil Code Section 3345 (discussed below). 
E. Conspiracy 
Because the court finds that Brown approved of and participated in the transfer of clients 
to the Norris Law firm, as well as all the steps to effectuate the transfer --substitution of counsel, 
letters to clients, new retainer agreements --and that plaintiffs have failed to prove any of the 
claims, the conspiracy claims also necessarily fail. There was also no evidence presented that 
Norris or Robinson conspired with Pak to breach her fiduciary duties by delaying the payment o 
rent or using BrownLaw funds to purchase leads for the Norris firm. 
F. Punitive Damages 
Plaintiffs failed to prove that any of the defendants acted with malice, fraud or oppression 
towards plaintiffs. With respect to the claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Pak for her non 
payment of rent and use of firm funds, the court does not find clear and convincing evidence tha 
such conduct was done with malice, fraud or oppression. At most, Pak was negligent in her 
discharge of her fiduciary duties with respect to the payment of rent. With respect to the use of 
firm funds, the court finds that Pak did not conceal the use of these funds and may have believed 
that these were merely advances that would later be evened out by subsequent distributions. In 
any event, her conduct was not malicious, oppressive or fraudulent within the meaning of the 
statutory scheme. 
G. Enhanced Damages under Civil Code Section 3345 
Plaintiffs seek enhanced damages under Civil Code Section 3345, which provides for 
additional penalties where unfair or deceptive practices have been used against senior citizens. 
That section provides in pertinent part:
