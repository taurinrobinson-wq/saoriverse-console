28 Pak breached her fiduciary duty by transferring funds from the client trust account to cover this 
lead purchase . 
With respect to the two $135,000 purchases ofleads from B Partners made on October 21 
and 22, 2019 out of the business account, $135,000 was transferred by Pak from the Client Trust 
Account into account 3119 to make these purchases and $135,000 came from plaintiffs own 
money. (See Exh. 8, p. 55 and Exh. 7, p. 86.) Pak was not able to present any credible evidence
as to why she was entitled to $135,000 of the client trust account money as her own at that pomt 
in time. Accordingly, plaintiffs have established that she breached her fiduciary duty to Baird 
Brown when she used client trust account funds to purchase $135,000 in leads in October 2019. 
In sum, the court agrees with plaintiffs that they have established that Pak breached her 
fiduciary duty to plaintiffs by using $188,500 of money belonging to the firm and/or Brown to 
purchase leads for the Norris firm. 
To the extent that plaintiffs claim Pak breached her fiduciary duty to the law firm in her 
handling of the cases which Brown retained after April 1, 2020, insufficient evidence was 
presented to support such claim. The evidence showed that Brown entrusted Pak, a non-lawyer 
with limited English skills and no discernible professional credentials, to finish up certain 
personal injury cases. No evidence was presented to credibly establish that she did not 
discharge her duty, attempt to complete those cases, negotiate liens, or obtain funds owed to the 
Brown Law Firm. As previously stated, Brown's delegation of these duties, many of which 
would almost certainly have involved legal work, or negotiations with a client and third parties 
on behalf of a client, to a person of Pak's minimal qualification s, showed poor judgment, perhap 
explainable by his health issues and deteriorating cognitive abilities. Nonetheless, there was no 
evidence of actual breach by Pak as it related to these retained personal injury cases, or damages 
caused by such a breach. 
3. Breach of fiduciary duty by Pak relating to payment of rent 
The court also finds Pak breached her fiduciary duty to Brown in her handling of the 
rental agreement. While the court finds that it is more likely than not that Brown permitted Pak 
to continue to use the office suite for her work with the Norris firm, given that she would be 
working in the suite to complete his cases as well, Pak was not transparent in her handling of the 
rental agreement or the lease payments , as she was required as Brown's fiduciary. Plaintiffs did 
not provide persuasive evidence that the rental payments, however, were being paid with 
Brown's money, as opposed to Pak's money, for the period after 2020. They did establish that 
balance is owed of $64,425, as of February 29, 2024. Subtracting from that amount four months 
of rent for the period November 2023 to February 29, 2024 (when Pak and Brown were barred 
from the offices), at an average base rent of $4000, leaves a "balloon" payment of $48,000. P 
breached her fiduciary duty to Brown by failing to pay one half of this amount, since her 
business was utilizing at least one half of the office space. Accordingly, plaintiffs Brown and 
Brown, A professional Law Corporation , are entitled to damages in the amount of $24,000 base 
on this breach. 
4. Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Pak relating to the Roh Case 
Plaintiffs failed to present persuasive evidence that Pak's conduct with respect to the Roh
