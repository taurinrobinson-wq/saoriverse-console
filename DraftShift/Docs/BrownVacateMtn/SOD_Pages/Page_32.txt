28 to do so. Instead, this was a voluntary withdrawal on his part without justifiable cause. 
Moreover, the situation is complicated by the fact that Brown now denies that he withdrew, so he 
is not even advancing any of these bases as legitimate grounds to withdraw or properly invoking 
a claim for damages urider quantum meruit. Finally, Brown has not presented any evidence to 
quantify the amount of work he did on the disputed cases prior to their transfer to Norris. 
The court concludes that where there is a voluntary withdrawal from representation without 
substantial justification , the withdrawing counsel is not entitled to fees under a quantum meruit 
theory, unless the client and new counsel agree. Here there was no agreement between Brown 
and Norris for Brown to retain any right to fees and certainly there was no evidence of clients 
being informed of a fee split. Accordingly, Brown is not entitled to recover any of the attorney 
fees earned on the mass tort cases transferred to Norris under a quantum meruit theory, even for 
work he may have performed prior to April 1, 2020. 
D. Pak's Counter-Claims 
Michelle Pak seeks damages against Baird and Ann Brown and against Andrew and Jonathan 
White for damages she suffered as a result of an alleged assault and battery committed by the 
Whites during their entry into the law offices on October 21, 2023. The elements of a battery 
claim are that the defendant touched plaintiff with the intent to harm or offend her; that the 
plaintiff did not consent; that the plaintiff did not consent to the touching, that plaintiff was 
harmed or offended by defendant s conduct, and that a reasonable person in plaintiffs situation 
would have been offended by the touching. (CACI 1300.) Pak claims she suffered physical 
injuries as well as severe emotional distress and seeks damages of $250,000, plus punitive 
damages against each of the cross-defendants. 
In weighing Pak's counter-claims, the court finds Pak to lack credibility as a witness. In 
addition to her constantly shifting and evasive testimony, Pak admitted that she had given false 
testimony in her deposition about her pay arrangement with the Norris law firm. (RT 1/27/25 p. 
18:6-21.) She conceded she was not just paid$ I 00,000 a year or under $30 per hour, but 
"multiple millions of dollars" over her tenure with the Norris Law firm. (Id.) She testified 
falsely that she had not made payments out of the Baird Brown Operating Expense Account in 
2021, 2020 and 2023, when the court easily found her signature on checks written on that 
account for rent and other items. (RT 1/27/25, p. 58:1-28 and exhibits 7-15.) Indeed, the court 
finds her testimony entirely untrustworthy. 
Reviewing the evidence presented by plaintiff in support of her counter-claims, Pak testified 
that she was given no advance notice that Brown would be coming to the office on October 21, 
2023. (2/10/25 RT at p. 11: 19-27.) She was called into the office that day, a Saturday, by 
management for the building, who reported to her that people were in the office. She testified 
that both Browns were present, as well as Jonathan and Andrew White, as well as a person who 
was either a security guard or police. She was threatened multiple times that day by Andrew 
White that she would be arrested if she did not leave. 
The key video here is Exhibit 15552, which is one of many showing a long standoff between 
Pak and Andrew White, who was purportin g to terminate her as office manager for Baird Brown 
and requesting that she leave the office. Pak indicated that she wanted to be able to take her 
own checkbook, although she was unclear and evasive about what she wanted to take. The
