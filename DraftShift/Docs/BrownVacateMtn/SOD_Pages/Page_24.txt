27 'undivided loyalty."' 
(Stokes v. Dole Nut Co. (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 285, 295.) 
(Order, 11/20/2024, p. 6; emphasis added.) 
Those duties were further elaborated upon by the court of appeals in Huong Que, Inc. v. 
Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400: 
The duty of loyalty embraces several subsidiary obligations, including the duty "to 
refrain from competing with the principal and from taking action on behalf of 
or otherwise assisting the principal' s competitors" (Rest.3d, Agency,§ 8.04), the 
duty "not to acquire a material benefit from a third party in connection with ... 
actions taken ... through the agent's use of the agent' s position" (id., § 8.02), and the 
duty "not to use or communicate confidential information of the principal for 
the agent's own purposes or those of a third party" (id., § 8.05(2)). 
(Huong Que, Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 400, 416.) 
1. Breach of fiduciary duty by Pak relating to alleged theft of clients 
Part of plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim against Pak rests on the unsupportable 
factual contention that Pak used fraud and deceit to steal existing clients and potential new 
clients from Brown so that she could go into active competition with him when she was still 
purporting to work as his office manager. The court agrees that had Pak transferred Brown's 
cases, solicited the clients to switch fim1s, purchased new leads for Norris -all without Brown's 
knowledge and consent -she would clearly have breached her fiduciary duty to Brown. But the 
evidence does not support plaintiffs ' version of events. As discussed above, the court finds that 
Baird Brown voluntarily withdrew from many of his cases, encourag ed Pak to work with Norris 
to create a new mass tort practice for Norris's own firm, agreed to the substitution of Norris as 
counsel of record on his existing cases, and consented to her using his office with Norris to 
create a new practice, while wrapping up Brown's few remaining personal injury cases. Having 
consented to Pak playing this dual role, Brown cannot claim she breached a fiduciary duty to hi 
and his firm. 
2. Breach of fiduciary duty by Pak in the Use of Firm Money to Purchase Leads 
Separately , plaintiffs contend that Pak breached her fiduciary duty to plaintiffs by using 
money in the Law Office's business money (BofA account #3119) to purchase $653,500 in 
leads in 2019. Those purchase s are as follows: 
May 14, 2019 wire transfer of $195,000 to B Partners. (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 38.) 
May 31, 2019 wire transfer of $48,500 to SMG (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 38) 
June 3, 2019 transfer of $100,000 to SMG (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 48) 
August 19, 2019 transfer of $40,000 to OPL (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 64) 
October 21, 2019 transfer of $135,000 to B Partners (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 86.) 
October 22, 2019 transfer of$135,000 to B Partners (Tr. Exh. 7, p. 86.) 
These are the transactions fairly presented in plaintiffs' closing brief and at trial. These 
28 are the only transactions which the court considers further as a result of the objections lodged b
