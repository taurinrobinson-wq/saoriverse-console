28 entering into this or any other agreement with Norris(Id.)He didacknowledge sending emails
to Pak in November 2020, discussing their negot1at10ns withNorns about the percentage split
(Interestingly Pak was demanding 50% of the fees received on Androgel, a demand on her part 
which would have created serious ethical issues for an attorney accepting those terms.) (RT 
1/28/25 p. 48, ln. l -52, In. 5.) 
Brown claims it was not until June 2023 that he first became suspicious that Pak was not 
working exclusive ly for him and that there was anything amiss with his mass tort practice.2 He 
claims he first realized there was something wrong when he sent an email to Pak, asking for an 
update on some of their cases. (RT 1/22/25 p. 119: 19 -122:28 and Exh. 1651.) In that email he 
asked for client name, case type, when the complaint was filed, summary of claim facts and 
when case would be completed and closed from a legal assistant. (Id., and Exh. 1651.) Pak's 
response was largely incomprehensible and aggressive, telling him her contract with Brown was 
"voided," but oddly not directly stating that all of the cases had been transferred to Donald 
Norris. Around this same time, Brown contacted a former paralegal Lucas Granillo, with whom 
he was still in contact, and asked Granillo to "check on the status of a few cases." Granillo went 
on Pacer to investigate some of their federal cases and found that Norris had been substituted 
into many cases. Granillo testified that Norris seemed "surprised" by this news. (RT 2/14/25 at 
p. 94:1-96:27 .) 
With respect to the decision to enter the office suite at 3055 Wilshire, Brown appeared to 
have little recollection of the decisions leading up to that step. He claims he did not know they 
were going to bring a computer expert to copy files or retain a security company to accompany 
them. (RT 1/27/25 am, p. 29:24-33:4.) He denies that he or his wife were the decision-maker s 
in barring Norris from the offices after October 21, 2023. (Id., at p. 35:24-36:19.) Later in his 
testimony, Brown changed his testimony , explaining that he decided to have security accompany 
them because he feared there might be violence; and that he went to the office with the intent to 
remove Norris from the offices with the use of security. (RT 1/28/25 at p. 68: l 5-25.) Brown 
signed the actual agreement with the security company and the computer forensics company that 
copied Norris's files. (Exh. 1657 and 1658.) 
Testimony of Richard Holstrom 
Plaintiffs offered the testimony of forensic accountant Richard Holstrom to quantify his 
claimed damages and to provide expert testimony on law firm accounting. (RT 3/5/25, pp. 32-
25.) Holstrom testified that, based on his review of the bank account records, in 2019 and 2020, 
Pak and Brown received roughly equal payments from the law firm during those years. (RT 
3/7/25, p. 34: 17 -p. 42: 10 Exh. 1697, 1699, 1700.) He further confirmed that the money that wa 
paid to purchase leads from the Brown business account appears to have come from money 
transferred into the account by Pak and that Brown had full access to these records in 2019 and 
2020 (and beyond). (RT 3/7/25, pp. 44-46.) Holstrom also presented lengthy testimony about 
the attorney fees Brown should have received from the cases transferred to Norris. The court 
does not summarize this testimony because, as discussed further below, the court finds Brown is 
not entitled to any portion of these fees. 
2 Around the same time, Brown claims he also discovered that the website for the Donald Norris 
law firm contained a link or "protected page," which included information about Baird Brown, 
well as Brown's photograph. (Exh. 1558 and 1652.)
