MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
I. SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
      Defendant Michelle Pak moves to vacate the judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 663 because the judgment entered is not supported by the Court's own factual findings and rests on incorrect legal conclusions. For purposes of this motion only, the Statement of Decision (SOD) is accepted as written. The issue under Section 663 is not whether the Court should revisit its factual determinations, but whether the legal conclusions and judgment follow those findings. Here, they do not.
      Specifically, Plaintiffs' core claim—that Brown did not know the leads were for Norris—is not a factual finding at all. It is a legal conclusion unsupported by the SOD's surrounding text and contradicted by the Court's multiple actual findings regarding Brown's knowledge, participation, and consent. Additionally, Plaintiffs rely heavily on testimony from Mrs. Brown that the Court expressly found "unlikely" and "imprecise," yet this rejected testimony forms no part of the SOD's actual findings. The Court's own words render this line of argument legally meaningless under Section 663.
      The SOD's factual findings negate essential elements of elder financial abuse, breach of fiduciary duty, and damages. The Court found that Brown was competent in 2019, had full access to the accounts, reviewed the transactions, raised no objections, knew the leads were not being purchased for his firm, and consented to the transfer of clients to Norris. The SOD also found that Ms. Pak funded the vast majority of the 2019 lead purchases, and "may have believed" she was acting within the parties' long-standing reimbursement structure. These findings cannot support the judgment entered. Further, the SOD contains no finding that Plaintiffs paid rent after October 21, 2023, and no finding that Ms. Pak caused any nonpayment—rendering the $24,000 rent award unsupported as a matter of law.
      Section 663 exists precisely for cases like this, where the Statement of Decision is extensive, but the judgment does not follow from the findings made. Because the judgment is inconsistent with and unsupported by the findings made, it must be vacated or modified.

II. LEGAL STANDARD
      A motion to vacate under Code of Civil Procedure §663 is proper where the judgment "is based on an incorrect or erroneous legal basis not supported by the facts found by the court." Code Civ. Proc. §663. The motion does not permit reweighing evidence or revisiting credibility determinations; the court must accept its own factual findings as written and determine only whether the judgment legally follows those findings. City of San Diego v. D.R. Horton San Diego Holding Co., Inc., 126 Cal.App.4th 668, 682 (2005). A judgment must be vacated when the findings "negate essential elements required to support the judgment" or when the legal conclusions are inconsistent with the facts found. Simac Design, Inc. v. Alciati, 92 Cal.App.3d 146, 153 (1979).
      Section 663 is designed to correct exactly this type of error: where the Statement of Decision contains findings that, taken as true, do not support the judgment entered. The court's task is limited to determining whether the judgment is legally permissible given the findings as written, not whether different findings could have supported a different judgment. When the findings and judgment cannot be reconciled, the judgment is "not consistent with or not supported by the facts found" and must be vacated or modified. Code Civ. Proc. §663.

III. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT A JUDGMENT FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY

A. Plaintiffs' Sole "Fact" Is Not a Factual Finding—It Is an Unsupported Conclusion
      Plaintiffs' opposition argues that Defendant "failed to address" the SOD's statement that "Brown did not know that Pak was purchasing leads for the Norris firm as opposed to the Baird firm." But this sentence is not a factual finding; it is a legal conclusion about Brown's mental state. Section 663 requires the judgment to be supported by the Court's factual findings, not by isolated conclusions.
      The surrounding SOD text contains no factual findings establishing this conclusion. The Court states only that it "could not find a reasonable explanation for the source of funds" for certain transactions. That is not a finding of disloyalty, concealment, or wrongful taking. It is a documentation gap. The SOD further states that "Pak had full authority and access to both of those accounts pursuant to her agreement with Brown," that "Brown was writing checks from the same two accounts in 2019 and so would have been aware of these transactions," and that "Brown made no objection." (SOD, p. 27:7-10.) None of this supports the conclusion that Brown lacked knowledge.
      More importantly, the SOD contains multiple factual findings that affirmatively contradict Plaintiffs' conclusion:
      • Brown was competent and handling his business affairs during the relevant period
      • Brown knew he was winding down his practice and facing suspension
      • Brown knew the leads were not being purchased for him because he was stepping back from practice
      • Brown consented to Norris taking over his cases
      • Brown introduced Norris to staff as the attorney taking over
      • Brown reviewed the transactions and raised no objection
      • Brown participated in the transition of his practice
      • The Court found that the May 2019 leads were purchased for Brown and only later identified as for Norris after Brown agreed to the transition
      These are factual findings. They negate the conclusion Plaintiffs rely on. A judgment cannot rest on a conclusion unsupported by findings, especially where the findings affirmatively contradict it. Because Plaintiffs point to no factual finding establishing lack of knowledge, disloyalty, wrongful taking, or undue influence, their argument fails at the threshold.

B. The SOD Limits the Scope of Any Fiduciary Duty
      The SOD adopts Judge Recana's ruling that any general fiduciary duty ended on April 1, 2020. (SOD, pp. 24:18–19.) After that date, the Court recognized only a narrow, case-specific duty limited to the few personal injury matters Brown retained. (SOD, pp. 24:21–22.) The SOD expressly found no breach and no damages within that limited post-2020 duty. (SOD, pp. 28:10–16.) Because the Court confined the scope of any fiduciary duty to this defined period and set of cases, the judgment cannot rest on a broader or continuing fiduciary duty theory extending through 2023. A judgment that exceeds or contradicts the Court's own findings must be vacated under Code of Civil Procedure §663.

C. Mrs. Brown's Testimony—Plaintiffs' Strongest Evidence—Was Expressly Rejected by the Court as "Unlikely" and "Imprecise"
      Plaintiffs rely on testimony from Mrs. Brown that Mr. Brown told her the lead purchases were a good investment. But the Statement of Decision expressly rejects this testimony. The SOD states:
      "Mrs. Brown also claims that she was aware that the Brown firm was purchasing leads in the amount of $635,000 in June 2019, which she thought was inadvisable. Her husband told her that it was a good business investment.... The court found this testimony unlikely, given that her testimony was imprecise and she admitted that at this same time her husband was not telling her the truth about one key issue—that he was under investigation by the state bar and facing a one-year suspension." (SOD, pp. 11:5-22.)
      The Court's credibility determination was unambiguous: this testimony is "unlikely" and "imprecise." The SOD further found that Mrs. Brown was unaware of:
      • Her husband's State Bar investigation and suspension (hidden for three years)
      • His transfer of cases to Norris
      • His winding down of practice
      • The Norris relationship and fee agreements
      • The Roh case substitution
      • The status of the Mick case and other professional details
      This is not a gap in Mrs. Brown's knowledge. It is a pattern of concealment. The Court recognized that Brown routinely hid major professional facts from his wife, which directly undermines any reliance on her testimony about his knowledge of the lead transactions.
      Critically, the Court used Mrs. Brown's lack of knowledge to support the opposite conclusion Plaintiffs want. The SOD states: "This further supports the court's conclusion that Brown knew he needed another attorney to handle cases." (SOD, p. 28:22-23.) In other words, the fact that Brown concealed the transition from his wife demonstrates that Brown understood the transition was occurring—he was managing the information flow. Her testimony does not establish Brown's actual knowledge; it establishes that Brown controlled what she knew.
      A judgment cannot rest on testimony the Court expressly found not credible. Plaintiffs' reliance on testimony the Court rejected underscores that the judgment is unsupported by the Court's actual findings.

D. The Court's Findings Establish Brown's Knowledge, Consent, and Participation
      A fiduciary breach requires unauthorized conduct, disloyalty, or concealment. Meister v. Mensinger, 230 Cal.App.4th 381, 395 (2014). The SOD's findings negate each of these elements. The Court found that Brown was competent in 2019, was "handling his business affairs," had full access to the accounts and records, and reviewed the transactions at issue without objection. (SOD, pp. 3:20–28; 6:1–12; 27:3–10.) The Court further found that Brown understood the purpose of the 2019 lead purchases, knew they were not being made for his firm because he was stepping back from practice, and consented to the transition of his mass tort practice to Norris. (SOD, pp. 13 n.4; 27:3–10.) These findings establish knowledge, consent, and alignment with Brown's stated intentions. Conduct undertaken with the principal's knowledge and in furtherance of the principal's expressed objectives cannot constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. Van de Kamp v. Bank of America, 204 Cal.App.3d 819, 857 (1988).

E. Navarro's "Extremely Credible and Even Guileless" Testimony Confirms Brown's Active Participation
      The SOD expressly adopts the testimony of Carolina Navarro, whom the Court found "extremely credible and even guileless." (SOD, p. 8:5–15.) The Court credited her account that Brown was already discussing retirement in 2019, participated in meetings about transitioning his practice, and personally introduced Norris to staff as the attorney who would be taking over cases. (Ibid.) These findings establish that Brown understood, participated in, and approved the transition of his practice.
      Under California law, a fiduciary does not breach a duty of loyalty where the principal has full knowledge of the material facts and consents to the challenged conduct. Skone v. Quanco Farms, 261 Cal.App.2d 237 (1968); Prob. Code §16463. Consent likewise defeats any theory of wrongful taking, because "[a] person who consents to an act is not wronged by it." Civ. Code §3515; French v. Smith Booth Usher Co., 56 Cal.App.2d 23 (1942). The SOD's adoption of Navarro's testimony therefore forecloses any theory that Ms. Pak acted without Brown's knowledge or consent.

F. The SOD's Conditional Findings Create Fatal Ambiguity Under CCP §634
      The SOD states that Pak "did not conceal the use of these funds" and "may have believed" the transactions were authorized advances. (SOD, pp. 27:22–23.) This conditional phrasing is legally significant. Under Code of Civil Procedure §634, when an ambiguity in the Statement of Decision is raised, "it shall not be inferred . . . that the trial court decided in favor of the prevailing party as to those facts or on that issue." Ochoa v. Anaheim City School Dist., 11 Cal.App.5th 209, 235 (2017) (quoting Fladeboe v. American Isuzu Motors Inc., 150 Cal.App.4th 42, 59 (2007)). Here, the Court's conditional language expressly contemplates multiple factual possibilities, including the possibility that Pak acted with authorization or a good-faith belief in authorization, making any implied finding of breach impermissible.

G. The Findings Do Not Establish Causation or Damages
      The SOD found that Brown authorized the transactions, knew the leads were not for his company, and that Pak money financed most lead purchases. (SOD, pp. 6:1–12; 27:3–10.) These findings negate causation and damages. A fiduciary duty judgment cannot stand where the findings show no harm. Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman, 51 Cal.4th 811, 820 (2011).

IV. THE COURT'S INDEPENDENT FINDING IN FOOTNOTE 4 FORECLOSES LIABILITY UNDER BOTH CAUSES OF ACTION
      The Court's independent factual finding in Footnote 4 on Page 13 is fatal to both the fiduciary-duty and elder-abuse judgments. The SOD states: "Although Pak did not admit this, the court concludes that she likely purchased the leads in May [2019] with the intent that they be used by Brown, but when Norris agreed to take over the practice, she then began to identify and treat these as leads purchased for Norris. The court does not find that she was prescient about being able to work with Norris, or that Norris had a deal or understanding prior to June 2019 that they would be working together in any capacity." (SOD, p. 13 n.4.)
      This finding establishes that Pak acted for Brown at the time of the May 2019 purchases; that no competing relationship with Norris existed; and that any later identification of leads as belonging to Norris occurred only after Brown agreed that Norris would take over the practice. These findings negate unauthorized conduct, divided loyalty, wrongful use, intent to defraud, undue influence, and causation. A judgment that contradicts these findings is legally erroneous and must be vacated under Code of Civil Procedure §663.

V. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT THE ELDER FINANCIAL ABUSE JUDGMENT
      The judgment for elder financial abuse must be vacated under Code of Civil Procedure §663 because the Statement of Decision does not contain the factual findings required by Welfare & Institutions Code §15610.30. The SOD's findings negate every statutory element, and instead established that Brown was competent, informed, consenting, and actively participating in the transition of his practice. A judgment that contradicts the findings made is legally erroneous and must be vacated.

A. A Fiduciary Breach Does Not Inevitably Constitute Elder Financial Abuse
      California courts consistently hold that a breach of fiduciary duty, even constructive fraud, does not satisfy the statutory requirements of elder financial abuse unless the court also found a wrongful taking, intent to defraud, or undue influence. Michel v. Moore & Associates, Inc., 156 Cal.App.4th 756, 762–63 (2007); Lazar v. Bishop, 107 Cal.App.5th 668, 684–85 (2024). Elder financial abuse requires proof that the defendant took, secreted, appropriated, obtained, or retained property for a wrongful use, with intent to defraud, or by undue influence, and that the conduct caused harm. (Welf. & Inst. Code §15610.30(a)–(b).) Courts emphasize that the statute requires more than a fiduciary breach; it requires conduct that deprives the elder of property and meets the statutory definition of wrongful use. Bonfigli v. Strachan, 192 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1315–16 (2011); Paslay v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co., 248 Cal.App.4th 639, 656–57 (2016). The SOD contains no such findings.

B. The SOD Found No Wrongful Taking, No Intent to Defraud, and No Undue Influence
      The SOD expressly found that Ms. Pak "did not conceal" the transactions and "may have believed" the expenditures were authorized advances. (SOD, p. 27:22–23.) These findings negate wrongful use, knowledge of harm, and intent to defraud. Under Code of Civil Procedure §634, conditional findings such as "may have believed" cannot be construed against the defendant, and no implied findings may be supplied to support the judgment. (Ochoa, 11 Cal.App.5th at 235; Fladeboe, 150 Cal.App.4th at 59.)
      The SOD found that Brown reviewed the transactions, raised no objections, and consented to the transfer of clients to Norris, made no rent payments after April 2020, and benefited from Ms. Pak paying much of the rent. (SOD, pp. 11:5–22; 23:23–25; 27:3–10; 29:8–30:13.) The Court also found that no wrongful taking of clients, fees, or office resources occurred. These findings foreclose liability under §15610.30 as a matter of law.

C. The SOD's Findings of Brown's Competence and Understanding Negate Undue Influence
      Undue influence requires "excessive persuasion that causes another person to act or refrain from acting by overcoming that person's free will." (Welf. & Inst. Code §15610.70(a).) The SOD found the opposite of undue influence. It found that Brown was competent in 2019 and "handling his business affairs," understood the purpose of the lead purchases, knew the leads were not for his firm because he was stepping back from practice, and consented to the transition to Norris. (SOD, pp. 3:20–28; 6:1–12; 27:3–10; 13 n.4.) These findings establish that Brown retained his free will, understood the transactions, and was not vulnerable to undue influence. A competent adult who understands and consents to the transactions cannot, as a matter of law, be the victim of undue influence. Bounds v. Superior Court, 229 Cal.App.4th 468, 478 (2014). A taking with the elder's valid consent cannot constitute a "wrongful use" under Section 15610.30.

D. Navarro's Testimony Eliminates Any Remaining Basis for Elder Financial Abuse
      The SOD's adoption of Carolina Navarro's testimony is independently fatal to the elder-abuse judgment. The Court found Navarro "extremely credible and even guileless" and credited her testimony that Brown was contemplating retirement before summer 2019, discussed leaving the practice in multiple meetings during 2019, and jointly introduced Norris to staff as the attorney taking over cases. (SOD, pp. 8:5–15.) These findings establish that Brown was not vulnerable, misled, or deprived of information. They establish that Brown knowingly participated in and approved the transition of his practice. Such findings negate wrongful use, intent to defraud, undue influence, and causation under Section 15610.30.

E. The SOD Does Not Identify Any Property Wrongfully Taken
      The SOD does not identify any specific property that Ms. Pak wrongfully took, secreted, appropriated, obtained, or retained. Instead, it found that Ms. Pak funded most purchases with her own deposits and assumed a client loan; that she funded or credited the vast majority of the 2019 lead purchases; that Brown reviewed the transactions and raised no objections; and that Ms. Pak paid most of the rent. (SOD, pp. 11:5–22; 23:23–25; 26:7–13; 27:3–10.) These findings negate deprivation of property, wrongful use, and harm, each of which is required under Section 15610.30. Bonfigli, 192 Cal.App.4th at 1315–16.

F. The Findings Negate Every Statutory Element—The Judgment Must Be Vacated
      When the SOD is read as a whole, the findings that Brown was competent, understood the transactions, consented to the transition, reviewed the financial records, raised no objections, and that Pak may have believed the transactions were authorized advances negate every element of elder financial abuse. Thus, the judgment does not follow from the findings made and must be vacated or modified under Code of Civil Procedure §663.

VI. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT THE DAMAGES AWARDS
      The judgment includes two monetary awards against Ms. Pak: (1) $188,500 relating to the 2019 lead purchases and (2) $24,000 relating to rent. However, neither award is supported by the Court's factual findings. Under Code of Civil Procedure §663, a judgment must be vacated or modified when the findings do not establish causation, harm, or liability.

A. The Findings Do Not Support the $188,500 Lead-Purchase Award
      The SOD identifies three questioned transactions totaling $188,500, but the Court's own findings eliminate any basis for liability or damages. The SOD found that Ms. Pak funded most of the 2019 lead purchases with her own deposits or credits. (SOD, pp. 26:7–13; 27:1–17.) The only unresolved balance consists of the August 19 and October 22 purchases, for which the SOD found only insufficient documentation, not disloyalty, concealment, or misuse of funds. (SOD, pp. 27:18–28:6.) Documentation gaps do not constitute wrongful taking or breach. Thompson v. Ioane, 11 Cal.App.5th 1180, 1194 (2017).
      The SOD further found that Brown had full access to the accounts, reviewed the transactions, raised no objections, understood the purpose of the purchases, and knew the leads were not being purchased for his firm. (SOD, pp. 6:1–12; 27:3–10.) Consent is a complete defense to fiduciary breach and wrongful taking. The SOD also found that Ms. Pak "did not conceal" the use of funds and "may have believed" the expenditures were authorized advances. (SOD, pp. 27:22–23.) Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 634, this conditional finding cannot be construed against her, and no implied finding of wrongful use or intent may be supplied. (Ochoa, 11 Cal.App.5th at 235; Fladeboe, 150 Cal.App.4th at 59.)
      Finally, the SOD found that Mr. Norris is not liable for any cause of action and neither knew the source of the funds nor participated in any wrongful taking. (SOD, pp. 29:8–30:6.) Because Ms. Pak is a non-lawyer and could not benefit from mass-tort leads, the exoneration of the only person who could have benefitted confirms that the transactions were not wrongful. Taken together, the SOD's findings show no unauthorized conduct, no concealment, no divided loyalty, no wrongful taking, and no harm. A damages award unsupported by the findings must be vacated under Code of Civil Procedure Section 663. Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman, 51 Cal.4th 811, 820 (2011).

B. The Findings Do Not Support the $24,000 Rent Award
      The SOD contains no finding that Plaintiffs paid rent after October 21, 2023, nor any finding that Ms. Pak caused any nonpayment. Without such findings, the rent damages award is unsupported as a matter of law. Section 663 requires the judgment to be supported by the Court's factual findings, not by assumptions or conclusions.
      The SOD explicitly found that "Brown made no rent payments after April 2020." (SOD, pp. 11:5–22; 23:23–25.) The Court also found that Ms. Pak paid most of the rent, often with her own funds, and that Norris contributed $15,000. (SOD, pp. 23:16–25; 28:17–23.) These findings negate any theory that Ms. Pak caused Plaintiffs to incur rent liability. The Court further found that Brown consented to the office-sharing arrangement, required Ms. Pak to use the office to finish his remaining cases, and accepted the arrangement. (SOD, pp. 23:4–26.) Consent bars liability.
      The SOD establishes that the lease was in Brown's name and that Brown ousted Ms. Pak and Norris from the office on October 21, 2023. (SOD, pp. 23:4–26.) Any balloon or accelerated rent obligation was caused by Brown's unilateral termination of access—not by Ms. Pak. Given Brown's nonpayment, Ms. Pak's substantial rent contributions, and Norris's $15,000 contribution, any alleged $24,000 obligation is fully offset under the SOD's own findings. California law requires damages to be reduced by any benefit conferred. Oasis West Realty, LLC, 51 Cal.4th at 820. Because the SOD found no wrongful taking, no misuse of funds, no causation, and no harm, the damages award cannot stand. A judgment that awards damages without supporting findings must be vacated under Code of Civil Procedure §663.

C. The Findings Do Not Support the Interest, Attorney's Fees, or Costs Awards
      The awards of prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs cannot stand because each depends on a valid underlying finding of liability and damages, and the SOD contains no such findings. Under Section 663, a judgment must be vacated or modified when the findings do not support the legal basis for any component of the judgment. The SOD's findings negate the statutory elements of elder financial abuse, negate any basis for damages, and do not establish a prevailing party. As a result, the derivative awards of interest, attorney's fees, and costs must be vacated.
      Attorney's fees under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 15657.5 are mandatory only when a plaintiff proves financial elder abuse as defined in Section 15610.30. See Arace v. Medico Investments, LLC, 48 Cal.App.5th 977 (2020); Gamo v. Merrell, 113 Cal.App.5th 656 (2025). Section 15610.30 requires a wrongful taking, undue influence, or intent to defraud. The SOD found no wrongful taking, no undue influence, no intent to defraud, and no harm. The Court found that Brown was competent, understood the transactions, consented to the transition of his practice, reviewed the financial records, and raised no objections. These findings negate the statutory elements of Section 15610.30 and therefore eliminate the only basis for invoking the mandatory fee provision of Section 15657.5.
      California courts require strict adherence to the statutory elements before awarding attorney's fees under the Elder Abuse Act. In Perlin v. Fountain View Management, Inc., 163 Cal.App.4th 657 (2008), the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of attorney's fees where the plaintiffs failed to establish causation by clear and convincing evidence. Similarly, in Nevarrez v. San Marino Skilled Nursing & Wellness Centre, LLC, 221 Cal.App.4th 102 (2013), the court held that enhanced remedies under the Elder Abuse Act require proof of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice, and that simple or gross negligence is insufficient. The SOD here contains no findings of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice. It states only that Ms. Pak was "at most" negligent, which cannot support an award of attorney's fees under the Elder Abuse Act. (Nevarrez, 221 Cal.App.4th at 102.) Because the SOD's findings do not establish elder financial abuse, there is no prevailing plaintiff for purposes of Section 15657.5.
      The award of prejudgment interest is likewise unsupported. Prejudgment interest under Civil Code Section 3287 requires a damages award that is certain or capable of calculation. The SOD found that Ms. Pak funded or credited the vast majority of the 2019 lead purchases and paid most of the rent. The SOD does not identify any net loss to Brown arising from the 2019 transactions. A damages award cannot stand where the findings do not establish harm. Without a supported damages award, there is no legal basis for prejudgment interest.
      The costs award also cannot stand. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, costs follow the prevailing party. A judgment that is unsupported by the findings cannot establish a prevailing party. Where the findings negate liability and damages, there is no prevailing party for purposes of section 1032. See Forman v. Knapp Press, 173 Cal.App.3d 200 (1985). Because the SOD's findings do not support liability, damages, or any statutory basis for fees or interest, the awards of interest, attorney's fees, and costs must be vacated under Section 663.

VII. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED
      For the reasons set forth above, the judgment entered on January 12, 2025 does not follow from the Court's factual findings and rests on an incorrect legal basis within the meaning of Section 663. The Statement of Decision, accepted as written for purposes of this motion, negates essential elements of breach of fiduciary duty, elder financial abuse, damages, and all derivative remedies. Because the judgment does not follow the findings made, Section 663 requires that it be vacated or modified. Accordingly, Defendant Michelle Pak respectfully requests that the Court vacate the judgment in its entirety under Section 663, or, in the alternative, modify the judgment to strike:

1. the finding of elder financial abuse;
2. the finding of breach of fiduciary duty;
3. the $188,500 damages award;
4. the $24,000 rent award;
5. the award of prejudgment interest;
6. the award of attorney's fees under Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657.5; and
7. the award of costs;
8. Any other relief the court deems appropriate.
